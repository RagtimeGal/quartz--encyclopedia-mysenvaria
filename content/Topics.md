Since the publication of the first edition of the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Arts/Literature/Non-fiction/Encyclopedia Mysenvaria|Encyclopedia Mysenvaria]] our taxonomic system of organization has remained nearly untouched. Concepts have been organized into five hierarchical categories; 

- [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Arts/Art|Art]], including things like cuisine, painting, writing, and sports;
- [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Biology/Biology|Biology]], which includes descriptions of plants, animals, and disease;
- [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Culture/Culture|Culture]], related to languages, jobs, sciences, and organizations;
- [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Geography/Geography|Geography]], like stars, nations, regions, and resources;
- And [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/History/History|history]], including events of the distant and recent past.

Each of these categories are split into a small number of sub-categories which may be organized further into smaller more specific categories. 
# Art
Art is one of the quintessential activities that sets intelligent life, such as [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Biology/Sapients/Human|humans]] and [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Biology/Sapients/Elf|elves]], apart from other life. Art may be defined as any activity partaken by intelligent life that uses creativity and imagination, a feature thought to be lacked by many [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Biology/Animals|animals]].

We subdivide art into 5 categories:

- [[Meta/Templates/Arts/Cuisine|Cuisine]], defined as any form of art that typically involves edible food, usually made for the purpose of being consumed;
- [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Arts/Literature|Literature]], defined as written works of fiction or non-fiction;
- [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Arts/Music|Music]], defined as sounds which are combined and arranged in a purposeful and often methodical fashion;
- [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Arts/Performance|Performance]], defined as the activity of performing staged play and theatrics, often for an audience;
- And [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Arts/Games|games]], defined as competitive or cooperative activities wherein individuals compete against or work with one another to attain a set goal.

Despite its deeply-rooted connections to culture, we have decided to separately categorize art because of how widespread and encompassing it is as a concept.
# Biology
Because biology is a science many of the core principles and theories that it garners are included in the culture category. So why the separation? Biology encompasses all life, from single-cells to megafauna all of which must be categorized and cataloged, as such biology serves as a category for the flora and fauna of the world and not a category for the actual theories and ideas that make up the science of biology.

Biology is subdivided into 4 categories:

- [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Biology/Animals|Animals]], defined as the animals of the world, created by the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Biology/Sapients/Gods|Gods]] to be locomotive autonomous working organisms;
- [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Biology/Plants|Plants]], defined as the plants of the world, created by the Gods to be autonomous territory definers;
- [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Biology/Disease|Disease]], defined as any sickness affecting the function of an [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Biology/Organisms|organism]];
- and the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Biology/Sapients|sapients]], organisms that can be differentiated from other fauna or flora for their higher levels of intelligence or creativity.
# Culture
Culture is characterized by a wide range of activity and customs in a society. As aforementioned we categorize art separately from culture not because they are unrelated by because art is such an encompassing category on its own.

Culture is subdivided into 7 categories:

- [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Culture/Beliefs|Beliefs]], defined as a set of things an individual, or in this case group, think to be true;
- [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Culture/Ethnic & Cultural Groups|Ethnic & cultural groups]], defined as groups of people who share heredity, beliefs, and languages;
- [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Culture/Events & Holidays|Events & holidays]], defined as any period of time recognized to be for festivals or celebration;
- [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Culture/Languages|Languages]], defined as systems of organized communication;
- [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Culture/Occupations & Trades|Occupations & trades]], defined as a type of work an individual does to contribute to society;
- [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Culture/Organizations|Organizations]], defined as a organized group that works for a common goal;
- and [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Culture/Science & Technology|science & technology]], defined as organized research and development to further knowledge and society.
# Geography
Geography encompasses everything related to the physicality of the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Geography/Natural Features/Plane|Plane]], from mountains, lakes, and rivers to nations, cities, and roads. Geography is critical to our understanding of the natural world, closely tied to our history. Despite existing disconnected from the Plane [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Culture/Sciences & Technologies/Scientific Phenomena/Stars|stars]] remain a very physical part of our world and as such are sorted with geography.

Geography is divided into 5 categories:

- [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Geography/Abstract Features|Abstract Features]], defined as non-physical geographical features, like borders;
- [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Geography/Artificial Features|Artificial Features]], defined as created geographical features, like settlements and monuments;
- [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Geography/Astrography|Astrography]], defined as the study of [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Culture/Sciences & Technologies/Scientific Phenomena/Stars|stars]] positions in physical space;
- [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Geography/Natural Features|Natural Features]], defined as natural geographical features, like mountains and rivers;
- And lastly [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Geography/Resources|resources]], defined as environmentally available materials used in production of goods.
# History
History is the whole of everything from our past, but we also categorize ongoing events here. History includes wars, events or breakthroughs, political events, founding's, and more.

We divide history into 5 categories:

-  [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/History/Biographies|Biographies]], defined as writings and descriptions on the lives of people throughout history;
- The [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/History/God-War Era/God-War Era|God-War Era]], defined as all events that occurred before the year 1at, characterized by a great war between the Gods;
- The [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/History/Post-War Era/Post-War Era|Post-War Era]], defined as all events that occurred between 1at and 609at;
