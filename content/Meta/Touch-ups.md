Touch-ups are [[Meta/Meta|meta]] callouts which exist to show that a page was considered complete as of its last edit, but the page may have information that could be added or elaborated on in the future as the Encyclopedia develops further. In other words, these are pages which could use touch-ups in the future.

Normally a touch-up callout should specify which section of the article could be elaborated on.

Readers can [[Meta/Contribution|contribute]] to touch-ups by leaving comments. Contribution by recommending further development, suggesting additions or revisions, or proposing merges or splits of the articles topics are all appreciated.
