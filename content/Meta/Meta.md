# Canon
Commonly when meta pages are referenced you will see canon mentioned. Canon is text that can be considered true within the setting, text that describes the setting with authoritative fact on the subject. In the case of this encyclopedia, canon refers to text written by characters within the setting. Non-canon text is text that is not part of the in-setting encyclopedia but nevertheless provides important information regarding the encyclopedia.
# The Project
