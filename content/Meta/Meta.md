# Canon
Commonly when meta pages are referenced you will see canon mentioned. Canon is text that can be considered true within the setting, text that describes the setting with authoritative fact on the subject. In the case of this encyclopedia, canon refers to text written by characters within the setting. Non-canon text is text that is not part of the in-setting encyclopedia but nevertheless provides important information regarding the encyclopedia.
# The Project
Mysenvar is a low-magic dark fantasy setting which can be explored through the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Arts/Literature/Non-fiction/Encyclopedia Mysenvaria|Encyclopedia Mysenvaria]]. Everything in the encyclopedia, while being my own creation, is designed to be free for others to use as they wish. Whether you're looking to run a TTRPG, need inspiration for your own story, or want a detailed world for your game, this project looks to provide a rich and expansive world for anyone's purposes.
# Contribution
The Encyclopedia Mysenvaria is written exclusively by myself, Ragno. While all writing is intended to come from myself, contribution to the project in other ways is welcomed. Helping brainstorm ideas in the [Discord](https://discord.gg/2yUDZ5j) is one way, alternatively the projects [GitHub](https://github.com/RagtimeGal/quartz--encyclopedia-mysenvaria) is a great way to contribute.

Each page is fitted with a comment section powered by [giscus](https://giscus.app/) and ran through [GitHub discussions](https://docs.github.com/en/discussions). The easiest way to contribute to the project is to log in to your GitHub and leave comments! Bring up undeveloped aspects of the setting, point out errors in the text, or simply discuss with others how you're using the setting personally.
