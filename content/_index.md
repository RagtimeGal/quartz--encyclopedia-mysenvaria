Our Academy has sworn to provide nothing but utmost unbiased facts, and we work with the most knowledgeable and [[Collaborators & Writers|credited scholars]] from all across the Plane to fulfill that promise. Nearly two-hundred years ago our founder, [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/History/Biographies/Sir David Attenborough|Sir David Attenborough]], would create the academy and bestow the gift of the encyclopedia to the Plane. Mr. Attenborough would vow his life to the pursuit of true knowledge, and the academy we know today would be born. Since then, we have worked to keep the encyclopedia up-to-date, and it is our mission to stay true to the vow that our founder made those two-hundred years ago.
