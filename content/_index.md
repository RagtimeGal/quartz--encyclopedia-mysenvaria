The [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Arts/Literature/Non-fiction/Encyclopedia Mysenvaria|Encyclopedia Mysenvaria]] is a comprehensive collection of articles written by numerous scholars. Published by [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Culture/Organizations/Academy Publishing|Academy Publishing]], the Encyclopedia Mysenvaria is only possible thanks to the help of countless scholastics from across the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Geography/Natural Features/Plane|Plane]]. In an attempt to diversify our cast of editors and writers we work diligently to collaborate with as many scholars from as many [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Indexes/Science/List of Scientific Branches|studies]] as possible.

The Encyclopedia's own [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Science/Branches/Taxonomy|taxonomists]] have worked to neatly organize and categorize articles into a set of primary and secondary topics. Their work has led to the organization of the Encyclopedia into six tidy primary topics, including [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Arts/Art|art]], [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Biology/Biology|biology]], [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Culture/Culture|culture]], [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Geography/Geography|geography]], [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/History/History|history]], and [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Science/Science|science]]. Each of these topics are then subdivided further into a number of sub-topics. Their organizational efforts are what hold the seams of the Encyclopedia's web of articles together.

It may seem like a daunting task, attempting to figure out where to begin with exploring the Encyclopedia, but tailored pages work to simplify the task. [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Indexes/Indexes|Index]] pages serve as lists of articles which share a topic in similar, for example the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Indexes/History/Biographies/Gods/List of Lesser-Gods|List of Lesser-Gods]] or [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Indexes/Biology/Animals/List of Domesticated Animals|List of Domesticated Animals]]. The [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Indexes/History/Timeline|timeline page]] and its cousins like the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/History/God-War Era/God-War Era|God-War Era]] or [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/History/Post-War Era/Post-War Era|Post-War Era]] pages serve as comprehensive chronological lists of major historical events.
