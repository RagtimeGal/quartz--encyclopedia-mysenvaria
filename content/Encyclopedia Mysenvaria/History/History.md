History is one of the six primary tropics of the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Arts/Literature/Non-fiction/Encyclopedia Mysenvaria|Encyclopedia Mysenvaria]]. History is a record of events, figures, and forces from the past which have shaped the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Geography/Natural Features/Plane|Plane]]. By studying history [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Culture/Occupations & Crafts/Historian|historians]] can seek to understand how the past influences the present and will continue to influence the future. History is vital to all other topics of the Encyclopedia, offering 
 insight into [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Culture/Culture|culture]], [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Science/Science|science]], [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Biology/Biology|biology]], [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Geography/Geography|geography]], and [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Arts/Art|art]]. 
# Biographies
Biographies are documents on the lives of people from the past and present, chronicling the legacies of key historical figures. Biographies document a range of individuals, from [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Science/Phenomena/Gods|Gods]] to [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Culture/Occupations & Crafts/Farmer|farmers]]. The lives of past individuals, especially influential ones, historians can better understand the impacts they had on society, the roles people like them played in past cultures, and the decisions which formed the world we live in today.

Lineages are a sub-topic of the biographic sub-topic and are articles depicting the dynamics and lineages of historically significant families.
# Historic Eras
Each of the four historic eras has their own sub-topic, which includes a timeline of the major events which occurred during that era alongside all of the minor events which occurred. The [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/History/God-War Era/God-War Era|God-War Era]] records all events which occurred before the year 1at. The [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/History/Post-War Era/Post-War Era|Post-War Era]] records all events which occurred between 1at and 609at. The [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/History/Golden Age/Golden Age|Golden Age]] records all events which occurred between 910at and 1214at. And the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/History/Modern Era/Modern Era|Modern Era]] records all events which occurred between 1215at and the present day.
