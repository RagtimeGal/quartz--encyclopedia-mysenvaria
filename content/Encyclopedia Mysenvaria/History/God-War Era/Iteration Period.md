The Iteration Period is a short period from the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/History/God-War Era/God-War Era|God-War Era]] defined by [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Culture/Occupations & Crafts/Historian|historians]] as having began in 523bt with the creation of the first [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Biology/Taxa/Plant|plant]] by the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/History/Biographies/Gods/Compound Gods/God of Hydrogen Cyanide|God of Hydrogen Cyanide]] and ending in 440bt with the holding of the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/History/God-War Era/God Councils#Second Council|second God Council]] and the passing of the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Geography/Stars/Creations Act|Creations Act]]. The iteration period is characterized by the iteration process Gods underwent as they created new [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Science/Phenomena/Organisms|organisms]]. The period would see the rise of nearly all [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Biology/Taxa/Plant|plants]] and [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Biology/Taxa/Animal|animals]] which exist in the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/History/Modern Era/Modern Era|modern day]]. 
# Prelude
The [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/History/God-War Era/God Councils#First Council|first God Council]] would be the spark that would light the fire in Hydrogen Cyanides mind. Documented in the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Geography/Stars/Star Systems/First Crater System|First Crater System]] a fight dispute between the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/History/Biographies/Gods/Elemental Gods/God of Carbon|God of Carbon]] and [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/History/Biographies/Gods/Elemental Gods/God of Calcium|God of Calcium]] would lead to the creation of the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Geography/Natural Features/Great Oceanic Crater|Great Oceanic Crater]]. The fight, having disrupted much of the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Geography/Natural Features/Northern Continent|northern]] [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Geography/Natural Features/Plane|Planes]] ongoings in the early war, would cause much debate and lead to the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/History/Biographies/Gods/Gods of Life and Death|Gods of Life and Death]] calling for the first God Council. 

The first council would discuss the ethics of the ongoing war, ways to avoid events like this fight in the future, and the possibility of ending the war. No consensus would be reached, but discussions during the council regarding definition of territory would lead to Hydrogen Cyanide creating the first plant. Hydrogen Cyanide would document the creation of the first plant in the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Geography/Stars/Plant Star System/Hydrogen Cyanide's Plants|Hydrogen Cyanide's Plants]] star, which would quickly explode into the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Geography/Stars/Star Systems/Plant Star System|Plant Star System]] as other Gods began discussing ways to improve upon this design.
