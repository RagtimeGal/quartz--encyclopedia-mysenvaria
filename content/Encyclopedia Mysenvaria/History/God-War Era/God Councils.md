The [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Biology/Sophonts/Gods|God]] Councils were a series of related gatherings of a majority of the Gods during the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/History/God-War Era/God-War Era|God-War Era]]. Initiated by [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Indexes/History/Biographies/Gods/List of Higher-Gods|higher-Gods]] each of the councils were highly important and changed the tides of the war. The councils are each recorded in their own [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Geography/Topics/Stars|stars]] created by the initiators. 

The councils would prove necessary multiple times throughout the war and would be influential in creating the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Culture/Sciences & Technologies/Scientific Theories & Laws/Natural Laws|laws of nature]] which are known today. Laws like the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Geography/Stars/Creations Act|Creations Act]] and [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Geography/Stars/Relations Act|Relations Act]] would only come into existence because of the councils. 
# First Council
The first council would be held following the first major battle of the war. A dispute between the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/History/Biographies/Gods/Elemental Gods/God of Carbon|God of Carbon]] and [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/History/Biographies/Gods/Elemental Gods/God of Calcium|God of Calcium]] would lead to the creation of the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Geography/Natural Features/Great Oceanic Crater|Great Oceanic Crater]]. Neither of the Gods would come out of the fight mortally wounded, but other neighboring lesser-Gods would not have the same luck. A great local migration would begin, with many Gods seeking refuge in local friendly territories where they could rest.

Watching the aftermath of the event in 587bt the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/History/Biographies/Gods/Gods of Life and Death|Gods of Life and Death]] would call for the first council to discuss possible ways to avoid events like this in the future and even possibly bring an end to the war. No consensus on ending the war would be reached, however many Gods would agree that catastrophic events like this should be minimized in the future. After the holding of the council Life and Death would create the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Geography/Stars/Truce Star|Truce Star]] to document the discussions.

The first council would be massively influential to the future of the war, not because it caused any truces or agreements to form between Gods, but because it would lead to important inventions, the most notable being [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Biology/Organisms|life]].
# Second Council
The creation of organisms like [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Biology/Plant|plants]] and [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Biology/Animal|animals]] would prove unfathomably important in the war, and later creations like [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Biology/Animals/Organisms of Mass Destruction|organisms of mass destruction]] and [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Biology/Sophonts|sapients]] would serve only to further these inventions. The second council would be held to discuss these inventions.

Once again held by Life and Death the second council would end in the passing of the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Geography/Stars/Creations Act|Creations Act]]. Fearing for the balance of the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Geography/Natural Features/Plane|Plane]] the God duo would bring up prevailing issues with these new organisms to the other Gods. Their words would not be taken lightly and a majority of Gods would agree something would need to be done, leading to the passing of the Creations Act in 440bt.

The new star would legally bind all Gods. It would not force them to stop creating new organisms, but would create strict regulations regarding how organisms should operate and how Gods should go about creating them. Questions regarding the act would arise in the year 426bt when humans would create [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Biology/Sophonts/Dwarf|dwarves]]. 
# Third Council
In the year 404bt the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/History/Biographies/Gods/Compound Gods/God of Water|God of Water]] would bring great attention to mortal-God relations after they killed the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/History/Biographies/Gods/Phenomena Gods/Gods of Earth/God of Tectonics|God of Tectonics]] for holding these kinds of relations. Following this event mortal-God relations would reach an all-time high, leading to the birth of [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/History/Biographies/Josh Soundson|Josh Soundson]], the first [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Biology/Sophonts/Demi-God|Demi-God]]. 

The birth of Soundson would start the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/History/God-War Era/Lover's Period|Lover's Period]], seeing the birth of numerous other Demi-Gods. Matter, with the help of Life and Death, would call for the holding of the third council in the year 386bt. Matter, feeling guilty after having ignored Water's pleas, feared for the integrity of natural law and balance. The council would end having reached no consensus and Gods would continue to hold these relations. The council would be documented by Matter in the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Geography/Stars/Failed Love Star|Failed Love Star]].
# Fourth Council
Matter would again call for a council in the year 337bt, still feeling responsible for ever-growing population of Demi-Gods. An epidemic had began because of negligence, and the council reached a consensus, passing the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Geography/Stars/Relations Act|Relations Act]] and ending the Lover's Period. The passing of the Relations Act meant the end of consensual mortal-God relations, as Gods were stripped of their ability to feel for mortals.
# Fifth Council
After a dispute between the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/History/Biographies/Gods/Phenomena Gods/Gods of Weather/God of Weather|God of Weather]] and [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/History/Biographies/Gods/Phenomena Gods/Gods of Weather/God of Lightning|God of Lightning]] the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Geography/Natural Features/Northern Mountains|Northern Mountains]] would be created. A group of humans, migrating west, would happen upon the corpse of Lightning. Nonconsensual procreation with the corpse would lead to the birth of [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/History/Biographies/Charles Lightningson|Charles Lightningson]], the first [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Biology/Sophonts/Womb-God|Womb-God]]. As debate would break out amongst the Gods about the ethicality of this event Life and Death would call for the fifth council in 272bt in an attempt to settle the war.

The council would be unfruitful, but many of the Gods in the north would go on to pass the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Geography/Stars/Anti-Womb Agreement|Anti-Womb Agreement]], agreeing to keep these kinds of mortal-God interactions to a minimum.
# Sixth Council
With declining populations each fight between Gods would become more tense. A fight between the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/History/Biographies/Gods/Elemental Gods/God of Plutonium|God of Plutonium]] and the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/History/Biographies/Gods/Gods of Matter, Energy, Time, and Space|God of Time]] would break out in 118bt, spliting the two continents, leading to the passing of the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Geography/Stars/Spatial Act|Spatial Act]], and indirectly killing Soundson in 69bt. This would all culminate in the holding of the sixth council by Life and Death, but would again prove unfruitful.
# Seventh Council
The [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/History/Biographies/Gods/Compound Gods/God of Sodium Ethyl Xanthate|God of Sodium Ethyl Xanthate]] would go on to rise to fame in the south, gathering together and forcing a group of southern Gods to pass the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Geography/Stars/Human Protections Act|Human Protections Act]] in 286bt. A dispute between a group of [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Culture/Occupations & Crafts/Wizard|wizards]] and Lightningson would lead to the creation of the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Geography/Natural Features/Great Tear|Great Tear]], killing countless people including the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/History/Biographies/First Elven Elder|First Elven Elder]] and Sodium Ethyl Xanthate. In their dying breaths Sodium Ethyl Xanthate would create the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Geography/Stars/Plea Star|Plea Star]], calling for an end to the war.

The actions of Sodium Ethyl Xanthate would lead to the creation of the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Geography/Stars/Star Systems/Ending Star System|Ending Star System]] and 37 years later, in 0bt, the seventh council would be held. A majority vote would be cast to end the war and preparations would be made. Gods would consult and debate and shortly after the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Geography/Stars/Harmonic Treaty|Harmonic Treaty]] would be passed, ending the God-War and marking the last of the councils.
