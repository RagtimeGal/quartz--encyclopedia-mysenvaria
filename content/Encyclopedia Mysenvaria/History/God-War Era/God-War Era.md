The [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Biology/Sophonts/Gods|God]]-War Era is the earliest era of history recorded by [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Culture/Occupations & Crafts/Historian|historians]], often defined as being the time between the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/History/God-War Era/First Death of a God|first death of a God]] and the signing of the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Geography/Stars/Harmonic Treaty|Harmonic Treaty]]. It is often considered to be one of the most well-documented eras of history because of the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Geography/Phenomena/Stars|stars]] which document much of its events. More stars can be dated to the God-War than all the other eras combined. Most historians and scholars attribute the God-War with having been one of the most brutal and bloody periods of history, with estimates for deaths at the beginning of the God-War ranging in the billions.

The God-War is often split into 3 epochs by historians, the Early War Epoch, Mid-War Epoch, and Late War Epoch. These three epochs are characterized by the changes in the environment of the war that took place when they set in. The Early War Epoch lasted from approximately 651bt to 523bt, from the beginning of the war to the creation of [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Biology/Plant|plants]]. The Mid-War Epoch would last from 523bt to 273bt, starting with the creation of plants and ending with the birth of [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/History/Biographies/Charles Lightningson|Charles Lightningson]] the first [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Biology/Sophonts/Womb-God|Womb-God]]. The End War Epoch would be the longest of the three and began with the birth of Lightningson and would end with the signing of the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Geography/Stars/Harmonic Treaty|Harmonic Treaty]] marking the beginning of the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/History/Post-War Era/Post-War Era|Post-War Era]].

While many events across the war are documented in stars, and thus dated, many stars contradict one another, especially in the early years of the war. [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Culture/Occupations & Crafts/Astronomer|Astronomers]] have worked with our historians to try and create the most accurate description of events across the war as possible.
# Prehistory
Prehistory is defined as the period of time before the beginning of the God-War. It is unknown how long prehistory lasted for, considered to be a dark age by astronomers and historians. The [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/History/Biographies/Gods/Gods of Life and Death|Gods of Life and Death]] were the first Gods to exist; their domain encompassing all existence. Documented in the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Geography/Stars/First Epoch Star|First Epoch Star]] Life and Death created the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/History/Biographies/Gods/Gods of Matter, Energy, Time, and Space|Gods of Matter, Energy, Time, and Space]] who would go on to join the duo and create the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Geography/Natural Features/Plane|Plane]].

Matter, following the creation of the Plane, subdivided their domain and created the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Indexes/History/Biographies/Gods/List of Elemental Gods|Elemental Gods]]. This action, documented in the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Geography/Stars/Birth Star|Birth Star]], would prove enticing to two other members of the creation quadrinity and Time and Energy would go on to follow in the footsteps of Matter. The [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/History/Biographies/Gods/Gods of Past, Present, and Future|Gods of Past, Present, and Future]] and [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Indexes/History/Biographies/Gods/List of Energy Gods|Gods of Energy Types]] would be created by the two respectively. Later, Energy and Matter would work together to create the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/History/Biographies/Gods/Gods of Material States|Gods of Material States]].

The actions of Matter, Energy, and Time would spark the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/History/God-War Era/Quickening|Quickening]], an event documented in [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Geography/Stars/Star Systems/Bernie's Star System|Bernie's Star System]] wherein the newly born lesser-Gods began subdividing their own domains and creating more Gods. This event culminated into the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/History/God-War Era/First Death of a God|first death of a God]] and the beginning of the God-War.
# God-War Era
## Early War Epoch
The first death of a God was interpreted by many Gods as a threat to their own lives, a reminder of their own mortality. Gods would begin fighting, cramped and scared, war would break out. [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Geography/Stars/Star Systems/Death's Star System|Death's Star System]] quickly scattered across the sky as Gods panicked and discussed action.

Shortly after the event a small gathering of 17 Gods would be formed, [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/History/God-War Era/The First Convening|The First Convening]] led by the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/History/Biographies/Gods/Phenomena Gods/Gods of Earth/God of Fulgurite|God of Fulgurite]] they would all be summoned for having something in similar, they had all witnessed the first death of a God. The group would be summoned to discuss what they had saw. Documented in the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Geography/Stars/Afterlife System/Afterlife Star|Afterlife Star]] one of the members, the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/History/Biographies/Gods/Energy Gods/God of Chromodynamic Energy|God of Chromodynamic Energy]], would conclude that there must be an afterlife and the belief of an [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Culture/Beliefs/Afterlife|afterlife]] by the Gods would see its inception.

The war would primarily consist of lesser-Gods fighting and killing each other, but more notable events including higher-Gods would occur. Lesser-Gods, during the early years of the war, would claim their physical and natural territories and defended them vehemently. Because of these new claims, some of the highest casualties of the whole war would occur.

The now-invisible [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Geography/Natural Features/Great Oceanic Crater|Great Oceanic Crater]] would be formed around 587bt in one of the first major battles of the war documented in the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Geography/Stars/Star Systems/First Crater System|First Crater System]]. A dispute between the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/History/Biographies/Gods/Elemental Gods/God of Carbon|God of Carbon]] and [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/History/Biographies/Gods/Elemental Gods/God of Calcium|God of Calcium]] over their natural domains would end in Carbon attacking Calcium and the crater being created. Both Gods would come out of the event alive, but other lesser-Gods would not.

With such a large area of land completely vacated Gods from around the crater would scatter and fight over claims. Eventually the casualties would force the hands of Life and Death and the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/History/God-War Era/God Councils#First Council|First God Council]] would be held. A truce between all Gods would be enforced and discussions would begin, but no decision would be reached and the war would continue on.

The [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/History/Biographies/Gods/Compound Gods/God of Hydrogen Cyanide|God of Hydrogen Cyanide]], inspired by material discussed during the council, would invent [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Biology/Plant|plants]] in 523bt as a means of autonomous warfare. Plants would be quickly adopted by countless Gods across the Plane and debates would erupt, forming the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Geography/Stars/Star Systems/Plant Star System|Plant Star System]]. In the coming years plants would grow to cover the whole of the Plane and their designs would explode with creativity and ingenuity as Gods adapted, adopted, and iterated on them. The creation of plants would mark the beginning of what historians call the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/History/God-War Era/Iteration Period|Iteration Period]].
## Mid-War Epoch
Some Gods would seek ways to combat plants more efficiently, [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Biology/Animal|animals]] would be the fruit of their labor, capable of clearing plants autonomously and at speeds unseen previously. Animals would not be invented by one God, but instead were invented convergently by multiple Gods. Stars like [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Geography/Stars/Carbonprint|Carbonprint]] and the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Geography/Stars/Star Systems/Mitosis Star System|Mitosis Star System]] detail the creation and iteration that occurred for animals during the war.

By 478bt animals, like plants, would inhabit all parts of the Plane. Gods, still seeking improvement, would invent the first organism of mass destruction around 476bt and shift the whole war at this point. Organisms of mass destruction would be encoded in ways that other Gods could not recreate them. Noxious gasses capable of killing any organism not encoded by the same God would spew forth. This event would flood the Mitosis star system with debate and debacle and adaptation would ensue.

Many of the Gods who had invented these organisms would pass away, and by 454bt the Plane would return to its semi-stable state. By 442bt [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Biology/Sophonts/Human|humanity]], the first highly intelligent autonomous lifeforms, would be created by the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/History/Biographies/Gods/Phenomena Gods/Gods of Earth/God of Porous Rock|God of Porous Rock]]. Located to the southwest of the Great Oceanic Crater humans would quickly spread across the central Plane. Humans were special not just because of their intelligence but because of their ability to fluently speak a simplified [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Culture/Languages/God Tongue|God Tongue]].

Humanities creation would only cause more debate amongst Gods, sprouting [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Geography/Stars/Star Systems/Alex's Star System|Alex's Star System]] and [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Geography/Stars/Humanity Recycled|Humanity Recycled]]. Debates regarding humans would become so heated that in 440bt Life and Death would call for the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/History/God-War Era/God Councils#Second Council|Second God Council]] which would pass the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Geography/Stars/Creations Act|Creations Act]] forcing Gods to slow down with their creation of new animals. Humanity would go on to become a vital part of the war, creating [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Biology/Sophonts/Dwarf|dwarves]] in 426bt. Gods would investigate how and why dwarves were created and discuss the legality of an action like this in the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Geography/Stars/Star Systems/Dwarven Star System|Dwarven Star System]].

Humans would have another unintended side effect, giving rebirth to the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Geography/Stars/Star Systems/Afterlife System|Afterlife System]] as Gods would begin to once again discuss an afterlife. A division would quickly form between Gods who believe in an afterlife free to all living things, and Gods who believe in an afterlife which only select individuals could enter. 

The first religions would be born from this, and humans would begin practicing them. The creation of these religions would also inadvertently create a conspiracy. The [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Culture/Beliefs/Greater God Conspiracy|Greater God Conspiracy]] would see inception and gather a small cult-like following of Gods. The conspiracy posed that Life and Death were working alongside the Creation Quadrinity to prolong the war so as to cull the lesser-God population and make more room for the higher-Gods. It would never gain wide-spread appeal

The [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/History/Biographies/Gods/Compound Gods/God of Penguinone|God of Penguinone]] in 421bt would be struck by an ingenious idea and the creation of [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Biology/Sophonts/Elf|elves]] would ensue. Documented in the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Geography/Stars/Star Systems/Elven Star System|Elven Star System]] was Penguinone's documentation of their creation alongside a defense of their legality. The star would be flooded with debate, creating the star system known today. Created to function as spies, hijacking the plants of other Gods territories, elves would spread across the Plane at unprecedented speeds.

In the east the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/History/Biographies/Gods/Phenomena Gods/Gods of Earth/God of Tectonics|God of Tectonics]] would spark conflict with the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/History/Biographies/Gods/Compound Gods/God of Water|God of Water]] regarding mortal-God relations. Water would attempt to sway Tectonics away from their relationships, but unfazed, Tectonics would continue as they had for the past 15 years. Water, fearing what could come from such a union, contacted Matter but found themself ignored. Irritated, Water would take matters into their own hands and slay Tectonics. The two would create the binary [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Geography/Stars/Star Systems/Lover's Stars|Lover's Stars]] in the process. The whole event would raise tensions in the east and south and following in the footsteps of Tectonics more Gods would partake in mortal-God relations.

In the year 388bt the first [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Biology/Sophonts/Demi-God|Demi-God]] would be born, [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/History/Biographies/Josh Soundson|Josh Soundson]] son of [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/History/Biographies/Dwarf Soundwife|Dwarf Soundwife]] and the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/History/Biographies/Gods/Energy Gods/God of Sound|God of Sound]], marking the beginning of what historians call the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/History/God-War Era/Lover's Period|Lover's Period]]. The birth would shake the philosophies and ideologies of many Gods and mortals alike. Matter, with the help of Life and Death, would hold the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/History/God-War Era/God Councils#Third Council|Third God Council]] to discuss the relationships between Gods and their creations. The council would reach no consensus and would disband having done nothing. 

Documented in stars like [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Geography/Stars/Mortality Revisited|Mortality Revisited]] and [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Geography/Stars/Two Breasts|Two Breasts]] alongside systems like the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Geography/Stars/Star Systems/Relatives Star System|Relatives Star System]] Mortal-God relations would continue to rise until 337bt with the holding of the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/History/God-War Era/God Councils#Fourth Council|Fourth God Council]]. Time and Space would force the passing of the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Geography/Stars/Relations Act|Relations Act]] during the council, stripping Gods of their ability to feel anything for mortals. This would mark the end of the Lover's Period and the end of consensual mortal-God relations.

Relations between the Elemental and Compound Gods was stretching thin and by 335bt the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/History/Biographies/Gods/Elemental Gods/God of Sodium|God of Sodium]] had caught wind of a plan by Water, the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/History/Biographies/Gods/Compound Gods/God of Trioxidane|God of Trioxidane]], and the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/History/Biographies/Gods/Compound Gods/God of Hydrogen Peroxide|God of Hydrogen Peroxide]] to expand their territories. The [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/History/Biographies/Gods/Elemental Gods/God of Hydrogen|God of Hydrogen]] and [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/History/Biographies/Gods/Elemental Gods/God of Oxygen|God of Oxygen]] would create the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Geography/Stars/Star Systems/Apology System|Apology System]] wherein they claim they have the situation under control but are put under scrutiny by other Elemental Gods. Nothing would be heard from Water, Hydrogen Peroxide, or Trioxidane during the duration of the Apology System.

Sodium, alongside Calcium and the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/History/Biographies/Gods/Elemental Gods/God of Iron|God of Iron]], would attempt to speak to Matter but would find themselves ignored. Desperate for action Sodium would visit the three Compound Gods on the new years of 335bt. A fight would erupt and Hydrogen Peroxide and Trioxidane would die, Water escaping amongst the chaos. The summer of that year would be characterized by the beginning of the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/History/God-War Era/Great Flood|Great Flood]] which would last until 321bt. Amidst the flooding all the Elemental and Compound Gods would be summoned by Matter and the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Geography/Stars/Elemental Act|Elemental Act]] would be passed to prevent future incidents.

In 306bt an elf by the name of [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/History/Biographies/First Elven Elder|First Elven Elder]] would become the first Elder, rooting themself into the ground somewhere in the east of the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Geography/Natural Features/Northern Continent|Northern Continent]]. This would be documented in the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Geography/Stars/Elder's Star|Elder's Star]] by the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/History/Biographies/Gods/Compound Gods/God of Sodium Ethyl Xanthate|God of Sodium Ethyl Xanthate]] who would become vital to ending the war.

The [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/History/Biographies/Gods/Phenomena Gods/Gods of Weather/God of Weather|God of Weather]] and [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/History/Biographies/Gods/Phenomena Gods/Gods of Weather/God of Lightning|God of Lightning]] would enter a dispute over each other's natural territories and in 286bt the two would create the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Geography/Natural Features/Northern Mountains|Northern Mountains]]. Ten years later, in 273bt, the deceased God of Lightning would give birth to [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/History/Biographies/Charles Lightningson|Charles Lightningson]], the first [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Biology/Sophonts/Womb-God|Womb-God]]. Following their birth the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/History/God-War Era/God Councils#Fifth Council|Fifth God Council]] would be held by Life and Death in an attempt to end the war but would once again prove unfruitful.
## Late War Epoch
For over 150 years the war would continue, but no major events would unfurl until 161bt. In a disagreement between Matter and Energy the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Geography/Natural Features/Eastern Archipelago|Eastern Archipelago]] would be formed. Documented in the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Geography/Stars/Effigy Star|Effigy Star]] it would be the first incident of fighting between two higher-Gods in the whole war. With God populations decreasing it was only a matter of time before higher-Gods became targets. Documented in stars like [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Geography/Stars/Population, Zero|Population, Zero]] and the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Geography/Stars/Star Systems/Census System|Census System]] the population of Gods across the Plane had plummeted and was nearing extinction.

Another disagreement would break out around 118bt, this time between the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/History/Biographies/Gods/Elemental Gods/God of Plutonium|God of Plutonium]] and Time. Documented in the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Geography/Stars/Star Systems/Half-life System|Half-life System]] the two Gods would create the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Geography/Natural Features/Southern Crater Scape|Southern Crater Scape]] and split the land bridge which connected the two continents. This event would cause the signing and passing of the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Geography/Stars/Spatial Act|Spatial Act]] and indirectly lead to the death of Dwarf Soundson in 69bt. Following their death the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/History/God-War Era/God Councils#Sixth Council|Sixth God Council]] would be organized by Life and Death in an attempt to end the war. However, unsuccessful, the war would be nearing its end as the population of Gods continued to decrease.

In 37bt votes to end the war would nearly become a majority when Charles Lightningson created the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Geography/Natural Features/Great Tear|Great Tear]] in a territorial dispute with human [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Culture/Occupations & Crafts/Wizard|wizards]] in the south. The tear would indirectly cause the death of First Elven Elder and Sodium Ethyl Xanthate alongside other minor Gods and people. In their dying moments Sodium Ethyl Xanthate would create the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Geography/Stars/Plea Star|Plea Star]] asking for the end of the war.

The actions of Sodium Ethyl Xanthate would cause debate amongst Gods and lead to the creation of the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Geography/Stars/Star Systems/Ending Star System|Ending Star System]]. 37 years later in 0bt the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/History/God-War Era/God Councils#Seventh Council|Seventh God Council]] would be held by Life and Death and a majority vote would end the war and create the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Geography/Stars/Harmonic Treaty|Harmonic Treaty]].
