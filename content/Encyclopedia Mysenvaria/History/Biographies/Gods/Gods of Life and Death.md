The [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Biology/Sophonts/Gods|Gods]] of Life and Death, also sometimes referred to as the fog, are the two oldest and most powerful Gods. Life and Death preside over the natural divisions of life and death; since everything lives and everything dies the duo are considered the most powerful of the Gods.

Life and Death are responsible for the creation of the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Geography/Natural Features/Plane|plane]] and the first higher-Gods, the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/History/Biographies/Gods/Gods of Matter, Energy, Time, and Space|Gods of Matter, Energy, Time, and Space]]. Life and Death are also indirectly responsible for the creation of all other Gods. Like many higher-Gods Life and Death operate in tune with one another, often in sync and as one.
# History
Life and Death, unlike other Gods, are documented in only a handful of [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Geography/Phenomena/Stars|stars]] throughout history. More often than not, many of the stars that mention the duo are legally binding stars, such as the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Geography/Stars/Elemental Act|Elemental Act]], [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Geography/Stars/Spatial Act|Spatial Act]], [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Geography/Stars/Relations Act|Relations Act]], and [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Geography/Stars/Harmonic Treaty|Harmonic Treaty]]. For this reason, many of the stars that mention them may be dated back to the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/History/God-War Era/God-War Era|God-War Era]]. 

Life and Death are only known to have written one star, the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Geography/Stars/First Epoch Star|First Epoch Star]], which documented their creation of the plane and their creation of the creation quadrinity. This star dates back to prehistory, before even the beginning of the God-War. Life and Death are subsequently mentioned in the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Geography/Stars/First Epoch Star|First Epoch Star]] which was written by the creation quadrinity. Life and Death can also be found mentioned in a few stars amongst the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Geography/Stars/Star Systems/Bernie's Star System|Bernie's Star System]], which was also created before the beginning of the God-War.

Life and Death are thought to have been primarily hands-off during the God-War, having not interacted besides to be buffers between powerful Gods and in attempts to end the war. The duo were present for each and every of the seven [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/History/God-War Era/God Councils|God Councils]] but were only responsible for calling six of the seven council meetings.
# Appearance
As per the Harmonic Treaty Life and Death always exist at the edge of the plane as a thick fog. Few have travelled to the edge of the world to see the duo and those who have explain it as an enlightening journey.
