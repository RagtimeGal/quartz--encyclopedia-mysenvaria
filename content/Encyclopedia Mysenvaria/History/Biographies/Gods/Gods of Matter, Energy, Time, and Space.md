The [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Biology/Sapients/Gods|Gods]] of Matter, Energy, Time, and Space, also sometimes referred to as the creation quadrinity, were the first higher-Gods to be created, born from [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Culture/Sciences & Technologies/Scientific Theories & Laws/Natural Subdivision|natural subdivision]] by the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/History/Biographies/Gods/Gods of Life and Death|Gods of Life and Death]]. The creation quadrinity are among the most powerful Gods but often choose to stay out of conflict, sometimes leading to them being called negligent or uncaring. Like other Gods of similar nature the quadrinity often act together in sync and as one.

# History
## God-War Era
Documented in the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Geography/Astrography/First Epoch Star|First Epoch Star]], around 690t, Life and Death would create the creation quadrinity. Tired of their power Matter would go on to subdivide their domain, creating the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Indexes/History/Biographies/Gods/List of Elemental Gods|Gods of Elements]]. This move would inspire Time and Energy to follow, creating the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/History/Biographies/Gods/Gods of Past, Present, and Future|Gods of Past, Present, and Future]] and [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/History/Biographies/Gods/Gods of Energy Types|Gods of Energy Types]] respectively. Energy and Matter would later work together to create the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/History/Biographies/Gods/Gods of Material States|Gods of Material States]].

The creation of these lesser-Gods would spark the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/History/God-War Era/Quickening|quickening]], an event recorded in [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Geography/Astrography/Star Systems/Bernie's Star System|Bernie's Star System]]. The quickening would lead to stress amongst Gods and eventually culminate into the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/History/God-War Era/First Death of a God|first death of a God]]. This would mark the beginning of the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/History/God-War Era/God-War Era|God-War Era]], indirectly caused by the actions of Matter. For this reason Matter is often even to the modern day blamed for the God-War.

In 337bt Time and Space would call for the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/History/God-War Era/God Council|Fourth God Council]] due to ongoing mortal-God relations. Time and Space would force the other Gods to sign the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Geography/Astrography/Relations Act|Relations Act]] into law stripping Gods of their ability to feel for mortals and ending the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/History/God-War Era/Lover's Period|Lover's Period]].

Following the actions taken by Time and Space in 321bt the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/History/Biographies/Gods/Compound Gods/God of Water|God of Water]] would be summoned infront of Matter during a small council between the Gods of Elements and Gods of Compounds. Water would be made to answer for their actions regarding the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/History/God-War Era/Great Flood|Great Flood]] during this meeting resulting in the writing, signing, and passing of the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Geography/Astrography/Elemental Act|Elemental Act]], restricting the rights of the Elemental and Compound Gods.

In 161bt a disagreement between Matter and Time documented in the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Geography/Astrography/Effigy Star|Effigy Star]] would lead to the creation of the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Geography/Natural Features/Eastern Archipelago|Eastern Archipelago]]. By 118bt another disagreement, this time between Time and the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/History/Biographies/Gods/Elemental Gods/God of Plutonium|God of Plutonium]], would erupt and result in the creation of the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Geography/Natural Features/Southern Crater Scape|Southern Crater Scape]]. These events would mark the latter end of the God-War.

The creation quadrinity would appear for the first time together at the end of the God-War during the seventh and final God Council. The quadrinity would go on to vote for and sign the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Geography/Astrography/Harmonic Treaty|Harmonic Treaty]] before dispersing once more.

# Appearance
The creation quadrinity are often described differently from description-to-description. *[[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Arts/Literature/Non-fiction/Encounters With The Quadrinity|Encounters With The Quadrinity]]* is a widely accepted and academically acclaimed book by [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/History/Biographies/Author of Encounters With The Quadrinity|Author of Encounters With The Quadrinity]] which details and dissects multiple descriptions of the quadrinity from across history with sources ranging from diaries to stars to scholarly papers. (Author) concluded that the quadrinity must appear differently to different viewers, dependent on interpretation.

According to the book the most widespread versions of the quadrinity among [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Biology/Sapients/Human|humans]] and [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Biology/Sapients/Dwarf|dwarves]] see Matter as made of surrounding materials, Energy as a bright light, Space as a nearly-invisible being, and Time as a figure moving backwards and forwards at the same time. Among southern [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Biology/Sapients/Elf|elves]] the largest difference is often seeing time as a plant growing and wilting.
