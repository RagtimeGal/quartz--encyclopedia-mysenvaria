Art is one of the six primary topics of the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Arts/Literature/Non-fiction/Encyclopedia Mysenvaria|Encyclopedia Mysenvaria]]. Art is a diverse aspect of the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Geography/Natural Features/Plane|Plane]], defined as the creation and expression of ideas and emotions. Art is intrinsically tied to [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Culture/Culture|culture]], [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/History/History|history]], and [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Geography/Geography|geography]], reflecting the values and lives of the people who created and endorsed it. 

Art in the Encyclopedia is divided into multiple sub-topics based on its multitude of forms, including cuisine, performance, writing, games, music, and sports. This section of the Encyclopedia looks to document creative works of art from across the Plane, the methods used to create them are reserved to their own topics.
# Cuisine
Cuisine is the art of food, including preparation and modification to enhance taste, appearance, nutrition, and other attributes. Both culinary techniques and specific dishes are covered in this section of the Encyclopedia. Dishes are often tied to cultural events and holidays, like [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Arts/Cuisine/Draconic Potluck|draconic potlucks]] after [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Culture/Events & Holidays/Dragon Hunt|dragon hunts]].
# Games
Games are competitive or cooperative activities where individuals or teams work together to achieve a common goal or compete against one another. Games can range from physical contests like [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Arts/Games/Wrestling|wrestling]], to mental challenges like [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Arts/Games/Nemein|nemein]], serving as both entertainment and bonding experiences.
# Literature
Literature are written works used to communicate complex ideas, tell stories, and record history. Literature is vital to the formation of societies, serving as ways to record historic events, laws, religious doctrines, occupational practices, and more. Literature is often divided into two categories, fictional works which tell fantastical stories to teach and entertain, and non-fictional works which serve to document the truth, like the Encyclopedia.
# Music
Music is the arrangement of sounds in purposeful patterns to create harmony, rhythm, and expressions. Music often accompanies events like rituals, but may also be performed simply for entertainment or personal expression. Music is usually performed with [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Science/Technologies/Instruments|instruments]], but may also use only the body or simple tools to produce sounds. Music may also be used to perform [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Culture/Languages/God Tongue|God Tongue]].
# Performance
Performance is the act of theatrical storytelling performed in front of or for an audience. Performances are normally put on for entertainment, and may depict historical or fictional stories. Some performances attempt to creatively reenact strategic games and may include members of the audience, making them similar to games.
