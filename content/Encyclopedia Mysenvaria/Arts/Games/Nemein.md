Nemein is a strategy board game which uses national currencies as the pieces of the game. It is a game which has permeated nearly all of the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Geography/Natural Features/Southern Continent|southern]] [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Geography/Natural Features/Plane|Plane's]] cultures.
# History
The origins of Nemein are lost to time, but current theories suggest it originated early in the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/History/Post-War Era/Post-War Era|Post-War Era]]. Anthropologists and historian [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/History/Biographies/Dian Fossey|Dian Fossey]] has posed that the game may trace its earliest origin to [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Geography/Artificial Features/Sextown|Sextown]] and the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/History/Biographies/Gods/Phenomena Gods/Gods of Earth/God of Tectonics|God of Tectonics]]. Many folk tales are told and have been passed down regarding the origins of the game, these tales often tell of Gods who would challenge mortals during the God-War or vice versa.


# Rules
The most common variation of Nemein is played with two players on a board consisting of hexagons.

Nemein is played on a simple hexagonal board with 2 players. Its a strategy game where players fight to control more of the board. Players must use coins of different nationalities, starting by choosing a handful of change which adds up to a corresponding whole fraction of their nations currency but which does not exceed a certain number of coins. (I.E. with USD you could choose a quarter, four dimes, six nickels, and five pennies, but you couldn't just choose a hundred pennies.)
  Heads and tails correspond to units or houses respectively. One of each action may be taken by a player each turn (I.E. you can move a unit and turn a unit into a house in one turn, but you cant move two units in a turn):
1. Move a unit;
2. Split a unit;
3. Turn a unit into a house.

1. Units may be moved to any adjacent tile as long as it is not occupied by more than one piece. When a player moves their unit if it overlaps with another coin it attacks. If the attacking unit is of a higher fraction of value than the attacked coin then it wins. If they are of equal or less value then a coin flip is made for who wins. The winner goes up to the next available fraction of value, the loser is removed from the board.

2. A unit which is not of the minimum fraction of value may be divided into two coins of the next fraction of value down (I.E. an American quarter(1/4) would become two dimes(1/10)) if they are on a tile by themselves. These two units exist on the same tile until one is moved.

3. If a unit is on a tile which does not already have a house they may be flipped to tails, becoming a house of equal value.

The end objective of the game is to eliminate the enemy or seize a certain number of tiles across the board by turning them into houses.
