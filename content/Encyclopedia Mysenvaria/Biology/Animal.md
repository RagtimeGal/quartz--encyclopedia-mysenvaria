Animals are defined by [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Culture/Sciences & Technologies/Scientific Theories & Laws/Tri-Criterial Classification|tri-criterial classification]] as any [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Biology/Organisms|organism]] which is capable of locomotion, or according to [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Culture/Sciences & Technologies/Scientific Theories & Laws/Evolutionary Classification|evolutionary classification]] as any organism conceptually evolved from the idea of a [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Biology/Plant|plant]] which can autonomously move or spread its influence by means other than growth. By either of these definitions 'animal' is an umbrella term which includes a great deal of organisms.
# History
Animals would see their inception into history during the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/History/God-War Era/God-War Era|God-War]], conceptually being created convergently by multiple Gods. Stars like [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Geography/Astrography/Carbonprint|Carbonprint]] and the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Geography/Astrography/Star Systems/Mitosis Star System|Mitosis Star System]] detail the creation and iteration that occurred. Animals would quickly become adopted by numerous [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Biology/Sapients/Gods|Gods]], spreading across the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Geography/Natural Features/Plane|Plane]] at unprecedented speeds. 

The idea and use of animals would be adapted and iterated upon for the rest of the war. Creations like the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Biology/Animals/Organisms of Mass Destruction|Organisms of Mass Destruction]], [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Biology/Sapients/Human|Humans]], and [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Biology/Sapients/Elf|Elves]] would shake up the war, and even cause some Gods to question the morality of what they were doing.

The creation of [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Biology/Sapients/Dwarf|dwarves]] in 426bt would be the first time an organism came into existence without the help of a God. This event would lead to the creation of the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Geography/Astrography/Star Systems/Dwarven Star System|Dwarven Star System]] in which Gods would investigate and discuss the creation and legality of the situation.

In 388bt the first [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Biology/Sapients/Demi-God|Demi-God]] would be born, a half-God half-mortal, [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/History/Biographies/Josh Soundson|Josh Soundson]], son of [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/History/Biographies/Dwarf Soundwife|Dwarf Soundwife]] and the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/History/Biographies/Gods/Phenomena Gods/God of Sound|God of Sound]]. Soundson would not be the last Demi-God, eventually leading to the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/History/God-War Era/God Council|Fourth God Council]] and the passing of the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Geography/Astrography/Relations Act|Relations Act]], stopping Gods from feeling for mortals emotionally.

Animals, and notably [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Biology/Sapients|intelligent organisms]], would inadvertently lead to the end of the God-War. Tensions had been rising for the last 150 years of the war and the death of the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/History/Biographies/Gods/Compound Gods/God of Sodium Ethyl Xanthate|God of Sodium Ethyl Xanthate]] by the hands of [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/History/Biographies/Charles Lightningson|Charles Lightningson]] alongside the death of [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/History/Biographies/First Elven Elder|First Elven Elder]] would lead to the creation of the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Geography/Astrography/Plea Star|Plea Star]] and eventually the signing of the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Geography/Astrography/Harmonic Treaty|Harmonic Treaty]]

As per the terms of the Harmonic Treaty Gods would reduce interference with organisms to a minimum, giving all organisms freedom to roam the Plane. In the coming century after the war many animals would go [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Indexes/Biology/Animals/List of Extinct Animals|extinct]] because of inability to adapt to the new world and its complex ecosystems.
# Classification
According to tri-criterial classification animals may be subdivided into a series of groups by a set of three criteria; diet, body plan, and historic niche.

Alternatively, evolutionary classification poses that animals may be divided into groups based on similarity of concept or execution by the Gods. For more information see the page on [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Culture/Sciences & Technologies/Scientific Theories & Laws/Evolutionary Classification|evolutionary classification]].
# Sapient Relations 
All sapients are classified as animals by both tri-criterial classification and evolutionary classification, but are commonly referenced or referred to as separate. While this is not the case, sapients still have a rocky relationship with other animals.

Sapients have historically hunted a number of animals to extinction, but have also [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Indexes/Biology/Animals/List of Domesticated Animals|domesticated]] a great deal of animals. Many animals are theorized by [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Culture/Occupations & Crafts/Biologist|biologists]] to go extinct within the century, and declining populations have become more noticeable and drastic.

Domestication of some animals began as early as the Mid-War Epoch of the God-War. It is theorized the first animals were domesticated by humans for use as [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Culture/Sciences & Technologies/Technologies/Agriculture|livestock]] or for companionship.
