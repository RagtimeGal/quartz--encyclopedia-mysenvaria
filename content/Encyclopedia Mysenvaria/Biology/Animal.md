Animals are defined by [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Culture/Sciences & Technologies/Scientific Theories & Laws/Criterial Classification|tri-criterial classification]] as any [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Biology/Organisms|organism]] which is capable of powered locomotion, or according to [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Culture/Sciences & Technologies/Scientific Theories & Laws/Evolutionary Classification|evolutionary classification]] as any second generation laboratorius organism conceptually evolved from the idea of a [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Biology/Plant|plant]] which can autonomously move or spread its influence by means other than growth. By either of these definitions 'animal' is an umbrella term which includes a great deal of organisms.

Within evolutionary classification the animal taxon is succeeded by 4 groups; [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Biology/Taxa/Vermin|vermin]], [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Biology/Taxa/Fish|fish]], [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Biology/Taxa/Amphibia|amphibia]], and [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Biology/Taxa/Synapsids|synapsids]]. Vermin are animals which lack internal skeletal structures. Fish are characterized by their entirely aquatic lifestyles. Amphibia are moist-skinned animals which undergo metamorphosis. Synapsids are animals defined by their specially adapted placental structures.
# History
Animals would see their inception into history during the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/History/God-War Era/God-War Era|God-War]], conceptually being created convergently by multiple Gods. Stars like [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Geography/Stars/Carbonprint|Carbonprint]] and the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Geography/Stars/Star Systems/Mitosis Star System|Mitosis Star System]] detail the creation and iteration that occurred. Animals would quickly become adopted by numerous [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Biology/Sophonts/Gods|Gods]], spreading across the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Geography/Natural Features/Plane|Plane]] at unprecedented speeds. 

The idea and use of animals would be adapted and iterated upon for the rest of the war. Creations like the Organisms of Mass Destruction, [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Biology/Sophonts/Human|Humans]], and [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Biology/Sophonts/Elf|Elves]] would shake up the war, and even cause some Gods to question the morality of what they were doing.

The creation of [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Biology/Sophonts/Dwarf|dwarves]] in 426bt would be the first time an organism came into existence without the help of a God. This event would lead to the creation of the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Geography/Stars/Star Systems/Dwarven Star System|Dwarven Star System]] in which Gods would investigate and discuss the creation and legality of the situation.

In 388bt the first [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Biology/Sophonts/Demi-God|Demi-God]] would be born, a half-God half-mortal, [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/History/Biographies/Josh Soundson|Josh Soundson]], son of [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/History/Biographies/Dwarf Soundwife|Dwarf Soundwife]] and the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/History/Biographies/Gods/Energy Gods/God of Sound|God of Sound]]. Soundson would not be the last Demi-God, eventually leading to the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/History/God-War Era/God Councils|Fourth God Council]] and the passing of the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Geography/Stars/Relations Act|Relations Act]], stopping Gods from feeling for mortals emotionally.

Animals, and notably [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Biology/Sophonts|intelligent organisms]], would inadvertently lead to the end of the God-War. Tensions had been rising for the last 150 years of the war and the death of the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/History/Biographies/Gods/Compound Gods/God of Sodium Ethyl Xanthate|God of Sodium Ethyl Xanthate]] by the hands of [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/History/Biographies/Charles Lightningson|Charles Lightningson]] alongside the death of [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/History/Biographies/First Elven Elder|First Elven Elder]] would lead to the creation of the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Geography/Stars/Plea Star|Plea Star]] and eventually the signing of the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Geography/Stars/Harmonic Treaty|Harmonic Treaty]]

As per the terms of the Harmonic Treaty Gods would reduce interference with organisms to a minimum, giving all organisms freedom to roam the Plane. In the coming century after the war many animals would go [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Indexes/Biology/Animals/List of Extinct Animals|extinct]] because of inability to adapt to the new world and its complex ecosystems.
# Classification
Animals are classified by their powered locomotion across both evolutionary and tri-criterial classification, although also classified as having evolutionary evolved from the idea of plants according to evolutionary classification. Within tri-criterial classification animals may be further organized based on their [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Culture/Sciences & Technologies/Scientific Theories & Laws/Dietary Classification|diet]] and [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Culture/Sciences & Technologies/Scientific Theories & Laws/Tri-Criterial Niches|historical niche]]. Evolutionary classification takes a different route, and divides animals into 4 taxa, being vermin, fish, amphibia, and synapsids.
# Sapient Relations 
All sapients are classified as animals by both tri-criterial classification and evolutionary classification, but are commonly referenced or referred to as separate. While this is not the case, sapients still have a rocky relationship with other animals.

Sapients have historically hunted a number of animals to extinction, but have also [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Indexes/Biology/Animals/List of Domesticated Animals|domesticated]] a great deal of animals. Many animals are theorized by [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Culture/Occupations & Crafts/Biologist|biologists]] to go extinct within the century, and declining populations have become more noticeable and drastic.

Domestication of some animals began as early as the Mid-War Epoch of the God-War. It is theorized the first animals were domesticated by humans for use as [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Culture/Sciences & Technologies/Technologies/Agriculture|livestock]] or for companionship.
