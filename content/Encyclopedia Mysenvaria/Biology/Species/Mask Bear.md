Highly specialized bear created to hunt Organisms of Mass Destruction. Today only found in the north, hunting what few OMD still live. Mask Bear have hollow sacs in their face which may filled with gas, expanding to create air-tight gaps across their face which allow them to enter OoMDs sphere of influence without being poisoned.
