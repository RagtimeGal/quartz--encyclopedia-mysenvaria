Pneumomagiosis[](Meta/Stubs.md)'s or Wizard's Lung Disease, is a dangerous illness most commonly affecting [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Culture/Occupations & Crafts/Wizard|wizards]] and [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Culture/Occupations & Crafts/Mage|mages]]. It is caused by inhalation of fine particles of materials that are high in concentrated magic, often in the form of [[Mythril|mythril dust]] or fine [[God Part|God parts]]. The disease has many side effects, with some of the worst including [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Biology/Disease/Wild Magic|wild magic]] and [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Biology/Disease/Spell Malfunction|spell malfunction]].

# Etymology
The anglicized name, Pneumomagiosis, comes from Greek pneumo- 'relating to the lungs', magi- '(art of) a magus', and English's -osis 'denoting a process or condition', culminating in the name Pneumomagiosis.

Pneumomagiosis is also commonly referred to as Mage's Lung Disease, Wizard's Lung Disease, and Magic Lung Disease.

# History
## God-War
> [!note]
This section is missing information which can be added at a later date.

During the [[God-War Era|God-War]] the art of [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Culture/Sciences & Technologies/Scientific Branches/Medicine|medicine and potions]] was not practiced by many. Because of this, many illnesses, like that of Pneumomagiosis, ran rampant and unchecked and many did not know what it was. Many people died at the hands of Mage's Lung during the war and many mysterious deaths documented in the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Culture/Sciences & Technologies/Scientific Branches/Astronomy|stars]] are now attributed to having been caused by Mage's Lung.

## Golden Age

## Modern Era

# Development
Pneumomagiosis is caught by inhaling particles of objects high in natural concentration, like some [[God Part|God parts]] and [[Mythril|mythril dust]]. This build up can mess with one's natural ability to cast spells and throw off the concentration of nature inside their own body. Not only this, but like [Black Lung Disease](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_lung_disease#Pathogenesis) the particles can also build up inside of the lungs and airways and cause inflammation and blocking. 

# Symptoms & Diagnosis
Patients often explain experiencing coughing, shortness of breath, chest tightness and general body aches, and hyper or hypothermia. [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Biology/Disease/Spell Malfunction|Spell malfunction]] is uncommon in patients, followed by the rarer [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Biology/Disease/Wild Magic|wild magic]] and hallucinations. 

# Treatment
Often the best treatment for people who contract Mage's Lung is to stop all of their contact with magic and fine magical particles. There is no currently known way of curing Mage's Lung and continued exposure to what's caused it can lead to worsening symptoms and possibly death. Brews and potions may be prescribed to wizards to help minimize their symptoms, but the disease does not go away.

It is not uncommon for a local wizarding associations to enforce a ban on magic for people afflicted with Mage's Lung. Wizards and mages who exhibit signs of wild magic or hallucinations may be executed or in some cases locked away so as to minimize their danger to the public.
