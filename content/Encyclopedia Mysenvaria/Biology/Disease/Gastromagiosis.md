Gastromagiosis, also called Brewer's Disease, is a dangerous illness most commonly found affecting [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Culture/Occupations & Crafts/Doctor|doctors]]. It is caused by the ingestion of objects which are high in their concentrated nature, most typically [[God Part|God parts]]. The disease comes with many side effects, including [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Biology/Disease/Wild Magic|wild magic]] and [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Biology/Disease/Spell Malfunction|spell malfunction]].

# Etymology
The anglicized name, Gastromagiosis, comes from the Greek gastro- meaning 'relating to the stomach', magi- '(art of) a magus', and English's -osis 'denoting a process or condition', culminating in the name Gastromagiosis.

Gastromagiosis' common name is Brewer's Disease, getting its name from the fact that often times those who drink the brew of doctors are afflicted with it.

# History
## God War

## Post-War

## Golden Age

## Modern Era

# Development
Gastromagiosis is caught by consuming anything that has a naturally high concentration of nature in it, most usually [[God Part|God parts]] but also sometimes [[Mythril|mythril]]. Consumption can block airways and the digestive tract, causing the inflicted to become unable to properly consume and digest food.

# Symptoms & Diagnosis
Patients often explain experiencing diarrhea, stomach cramps, nausea, vomiting, and hyper or hypothermia. [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Biology/Disease/Spell Malfunction|Spell malfunction]] and [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Biology/Disease/Wild Magic|wild magic]] are also rare side effects of catching the disease.

Diagnosis can be difficult unless rarer symptoms are being experienced or if lesser symptoms are displayed for a long period of time. Because of this the effected can go quite some time before it is properly diagnosed and treated.

# Treatment
The most common way to treat Gastromagiosis is to just let it ride out. Usually whatever has been consumed  will naturally pass through the inflicted's digestive tract. If, however, symptoms do not let up removal of whatever was consumed may be warranted. This is a dangerous procedure which if not properly taken care of afterwards can lead to death.
