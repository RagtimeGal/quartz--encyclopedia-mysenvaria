Plants are defined by [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Science/Models/Criterial Classification|tri-criterial classification]] as any [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Science/Phenomena/Organisms|organism]] incapable of powered locomotion, or by [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Science/Models/Evolutionary Classification|evolutionary classification]] as any second generation laboratorius organism conceptually evolved from the idea of a sessile organism capable of autonomous work. Within evolutionary classification the taxon of plants is succeeded by aseminifers and [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Biology/Taxa/Seminifer|seminifers]], being plants capable of asexual and sexual reproduction respectively.
