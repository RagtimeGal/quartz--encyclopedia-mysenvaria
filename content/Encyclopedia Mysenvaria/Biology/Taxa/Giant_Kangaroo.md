Created following the success of the Northern Kangaroo. Giant Kangaroo are rare in the modern day, found only in select regions of the great southern deserts. Giant Kangaroo like their relatives are characterized by their hunched postures and powerful hindlimbs and tails, made for powerful hops and kicks. Some members of this species may stand to be over 2 meters in height and are often a dull tan across much of their body, although males have blue and yellow splotches across their bellies and tails.
