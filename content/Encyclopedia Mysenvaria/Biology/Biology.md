Biology is one of the six primary topics of the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Arts/Literature/Non-fiction/Encyclopedia Mysenvaria|Encyclopedia Mysenvaria]]. Biology is a diverse [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Science/Science#Branches|scientific branch]] which focuses on the research of [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Science/Phenomena/Organisms|organisms]]. Biology is an umbrella branch, containing other studies like [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Science/Branches/Biogeography|biogeography]], [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Science/Branches/Bioastronomy|bioastronomy]], [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Science/Branches/Genetics|genetics]], [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Science/Branches/Sociobiology|sociobiology]], and more.

Whilst biology is a scientific branch it is separated as its own topic in the Encyclopedia. Articles in the biology topic aim to document organisms and afflictions from across the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Geography/Natural Features/Plane|Plane]]. Broader biology articles, like those on phenomena like [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Science/Phenomena/Sophonts|sophonts]] or those on models like [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Science/Models/Body Plan|body plans]], are classified under the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Science/Science|science]] topic.
# Disease
Diseases are ailments, afflictions, or otherwise abnormal conditions which arise in organisms and impact the normal function of the body or mind. Diseases can range from simple bacterial infections to complex parasitic relationships. The study of diseases is often considered part of [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Science/Branches/Medicine|medical]] biology, with the objective of understanding ways to combat these ailments.
# Taxa
Taxon are groups of populations of conceptually related organisms, classified either through [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Science/Models/Evolutionary Classification|evolutionary]] or [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Science/Models/Criterial Classification|criterial]] classification systems. Classification of organisms usually takes into account their [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Science/Branches/Biohistory|biohistory]] and conceptual relevance to one another. A taxon is usually referred to as a family when it contains species.

Taxa link together in a way that is often described as a tree. The base of this tree is often considered to be the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Biology/Taxa/Plant|plant]] taxon. The [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Indexes/Biology/Taxa/List of Evolutionary Taxa by Hierarchal Order|List of Evolutionary Taxa by Hierarchal Order]] page serves as a great jumping point to explore the evolutionary tree of the Plane.
# Species
Species are more specific taxon that include populations of highly related organisms. Populations of organisms may evolve genetically to create new species, but [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/History/History|historically]] a majority of species were created by the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Science/Phenomena/Gods|Gods]] amidst the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/History/God-War Era/God-War Era|God-War]]. Species each have uniquely interesting behaviors and interactions with one another and the world that create the different [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Science/Phenomena/Biomes|biomes]] of the Plane.
