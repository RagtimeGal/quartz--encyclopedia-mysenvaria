Biology is a [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Culture/Science & Technology|scientific branch]] focused on the study of [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Biology/Organisms|living things]]. It is an umbrella branch, encompassing a number of other fields such as [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Culture/Sciences & Technologies/Scientific Branches/Anatomy|anatomy]], [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Culture/Sciences & Technologies/Scientific Branches/Zoology|zoology]], [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Culture/Sciences & Technologies/Scientific Branches/Physiology|physiology]], [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Culture/Sciences & Technologies/Scientific Branches/Taxonomy|taxonomy]], [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Culture/Sciences & Technologies/Scientific Branches/Paleontology|paleontology]], and [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Culture/Sciences & Technologies/Scientific Branches/Immunology|immunology]]. [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Culture/Occupations & Crafts/Biologist|Biologists]] use a great diversity of tools to study the number of different aspects each of these fields cover.
# Overview
## Organization
Taxonomy is the branch of biology that focuses on the classification and organization of organisms, the most widely used and accepted system of classification is [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Culture/Sciences & Technologies/Scientific Theories & Laws/Tri-Criterial Classification|tri-criterial classification]]. This system classifies organisms based on 3 criteria; diet, body plan, and historic niche. Most importantly of these 3 areas is body plan, where organisms are classified as either being incapable of locomotion (a [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Biology/Plants|plant]]) or capable of locomotion (an [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Biology/Animals|animal]]).

Tri-criterial classification is not the only way to organize organisms, however. [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Culture/Sciences & Technologies/Scientific Theories & Laws/Evolutionary Classification|Evolutionary classification]] was created to classify organisms by conceptual evolution. Evolutionary classification says that [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Biology/Sapients/Gods|Gods]] built upon the concept and idea of organisms as they created them during the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/History/God-War Era/God-War Era|God-War]], and as such organisms can be organized by evolution of ideas. This type of classification combines many fields of biology, including [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Culture/Sciences & Technologies/Scientific Branches/Bioastronomy|bioastronomy]], paleontology, and [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Culture/Sciences & Technologies/Scientific Branches/Genetics|genetics]], and is still an ongoing and growing form of classification.
## History
[[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Culture/Sciences & Technologies/Scientific Branches/Biohistory|Biohistory]] is the study of organic history, including the creation of organisms and their historic use by Gods. Biohistory combines fields like bioastronomy and paleontology to form accurate predictions as to the original function of organisms. Biohistory proposes that [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Biology/Plants|plants]] were the first organisms, created by the Gods to serve as autonomous territorial definition, defending and fighting each other without the input of the Gods. The concept of plants would evolve in complexity and become [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Biology/Animals|animals]], now capable of autonomous mobility they were utilized by Gods as a way to not just fight for land but for real power.
## Makeup
Genetics, anatomy, and physiology are a few of the many fields of biology which focus on the makeup of organisms, both physical and not.
## Behavior
Sociobiology and [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Culture/Sciences & Technologies/Scientific Branches/Ecology|ecology]] are two fields which focus on the behavior and interactions of organisms both amongst themselves and their environments. 
## Medicine
Medical biology is the study of [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Biology/Disease|disease]] at a biological level, it is not to be confused with [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Culture/Sciences & Technologies/Scientific Branches/Medicine|medicine]], which is the applied knowledge of medical biology. Medical biology, and medicine in general, was one of the first practiced forms of biology, occurring as early as the formation of the first city-states during the God-War.
