Humans were the first highly intelligent fully autonomous conscious [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Biology/Animal|animals]] to be created by the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Biology/Sophonts/Gods|Gods]]. Designed by a small group of Gods and eventually created by the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/History/Biographies/Gods/Phenomena Gods/God of Porous Rock|God of Porous Rock]] humans would go on to become fundamental to the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/History/God-War Era/God-War Era|God-War]], changing the tide of the war and become one of the most successful organisms ever.

Humans are responsible for the creation of the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Biology/Sophonts/Dwarf|dwarves]].
# History
## God-War Era
Humans would be created by the God of Porous Rock around 442bt. Porous Rock, the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/History/Biographies/Gods/Elemental Gods/God of Carbon|God of Carbon]] and the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/History/Biographies/Gods/Compound Gods/God of Hydrogen Cyanide|God of Hydrogen Cyanide]] would document the creation of humanity in the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Geography/Astrography/Star Systems/Humanity Created|Humanity Created System]]. Porous Rock, inspired by the earlier creations of both [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Biology/Plant|plants]] by Hydrogen Cyanide and [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Biology/Animal|animals]] with the help of Carbon, would contact Hydrogen Cyanide and Carbon and propose the concept of humanity.

Humans would first appear in Porous Rocks territory, southwest of the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Geography/Natural Features/Great Oceanic Crater|Great Oceanic Crater]]. Their creation would not remain unnoticed for long, as neighboring Gods would quickly begin to civilly attack Porous Rock in [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Geography/Astrography/Humanity Recycled|Humanity Recycled]]. The ethicality and use of humans would become highly debated and Humanity Recycled would grow to become one of the largest star systems. Other Gods would begin adapting the human design, debates between Gods would continue to grow heated and soon the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/History/Biographies/Gods/Gods of Life and Death|Gods of Life and Death]] would call for the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/History/God-War Era/God Councils#Second Council|Second God Council]] passing the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Geography/Astrography/Creations Act|Creations Act]] in 440bt.

Humanity would create the dwarves sometime around 426bt, leading to the creation of the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Geography/Astrography/Star Systems/Dwarven Star System|Dwarven Star System]] wherein Gods would investigate the creation and legality of the dwarves. The [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/History/Biographies/Gods/Compound Gods/God of Penguinone|God of Penguinone]], inspired by topics discussed in the Second God Council, would create elves in 421bt. The [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Geography/Astrography/Star Systems/Elven Star System|Elven Star System]], created by [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/History/Biographies/Gods/Compound Gods/God of Penguinone|Penguinone]], would detail the creation of the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Biology/Sophonts/Elf|elves]] and defend their legality.

By 411bt notable small human-dominated city-states would appear, scattered across much of the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Geography/Natural Features/Plane|Plane]]. Many of these cities would live under the protection of a God or Gods, despite this though many would still see collapse before the end of the century and all before the end of the war. In the north [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Geography/Artificial Features/Athens|Athens]], [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Geography/Artificial Features/Babylon|Babylon]], and [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Geography/Artificial Features/Eridu|Eridu]], and in the south, [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Geography/Artificial Features/Jerusalem|Jerusalem]], [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Geography/Artificial Features/Memphis|Memphis]], [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Geography/Artificial Features/Sextown|Sextown]], [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Geography/Artificial Features/Sidon|Sidon]], and [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Geography/Artificial Features/Uruk|Uruk]] would be the most notable of the city-states.

The close proximity of mortals and Gods would lead to relations deemed unethical and naturally incorrect by many Gods. The [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/History/Biographies/Gods/Phenomena Gods/God of Tectonics|God of Tectonics]] would share such relations. Located in the eastern city of Sextown, Tectonics would be watched closely by a neighboring God, the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/History/Biographies/Gods/Compound Gods/God of Water|God of Water]], who in late 404bt would confront Tectonics and attempt to sway them away from these relations. Tectonics would ignore the words of Water and continue with their relationships. Water, fearing what could come from such unions, contacted the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/History/Biographies/Gods/Gods of Matter, Energy, Time, and Space|God of Matter]], but would be ignored. Water would take matters into their own hands, slaying Tectonics. In their battle the two would create the binary [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Geography/Astrography/Star Systems/Lover's Stars|Lover's Stars]]. This event would raise eastern and southern tensions and lead to more widespread mortal-God relations.

In 388bt, following the birth of the first [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Biology/Sophonts/Demi-God|Demi-God]], [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/History/Biographies/Josh Soundson|Josh Soundson]], a spike in the birth of Demi-Gods would occur. Three human Demi-Gods would be documented in [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Geography/Astrography/Two Breasts|Two Breasts]], [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Geography/Astrography/Demi-Human|Demi-Human]], and the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Geography/Astrography/Star Systems/Forever Alone|Forever Alone]] system. By 337bt Time and Space would hold the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/History/God-War Era/God Councils#Fourth Council|Fourth God Council]] and force the passing of the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Geography/Astrography/Relations Act|Relations Act]] ending consensual mortal-God relations.

Following the events of the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/History/God-War Era/Great Flood|Great Flood]] in 321bt many of the great human city-states which were not rested upon the continental Plane would find themselves destroyed, flooded by the God of Water. The flood would divide the world into the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Geography/Natural Features/Northern Continent|Northern Continent]] and the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Geography/Natural Features/Southern Continent|Southern Continent]], although the two would remain connected by a massive land bridge. This event would also see the rise of the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/History/Biographies/Gods/Compound Gods/God of Sodium Ethyl Xanthate|God of Sodium Ethyl Xanthate]], who would vehemently fight for the rights of humans, elves, and dwarves.

By 286bt the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/History/Biographies/Gods/Phenomena Gods/God of Weather|God of Weather]] and [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/History/Biographies/Gods/Phenomena Gods/God of Lightning|God of Lightning]] would enter a dispute, creating the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Geography/Natural Features/Northern Mountains|Northern Mountains]] and simultaneously wiping out all major human-dominated city-states across the entirety of the Northern Continent. One of the last remaining human tribes in the north would later go on to give rise to the first [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Biology/Sophonts/Womb-God|Womb-God]], [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/History/Biographies/Charles Lightningson|Charles Lightningson]]. Desperate for some form of change, Sodium Ethyl Xanthate would force a large number of southern Gods to sign the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Geography/Astrography/Human Protections Act|Human Protections Act]].

Late into the year of 161bt, in a disagreement between Matter and Energy, the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Geography/Natural Features/Eastern Archipelago|Eastern Archipelago]] would be created. The archipelago would go relatively untouched by humanity, instead giving way to a flood of dwarves. A few minor human tribes would find their way onto the islands, but few would sustain.

In 37bt Charles Lightningson would create the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Geography/Natural Features/Great Tear|Great Tear]] in a territorial dispute with a hunting group from the southern city-state of [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Geography/Artificial Features/Ur|Ur]]. The tear would destroy the entirety of the city and create a great vertical gash across the entirety of the Plane. The actions of Lightningson would lead to the death of the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/History/Biographies/First Elven Elder|First Elven Elder]], Sodium Ethyl Xanthate, and other undocumented Lesser-Gods. This event would inadvertently lead to the end of the war.
## Post-War Era
The end of the God-War meant the signing of the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Geography/Astrography/Harmonic Treaty|Harmonic Treaty]] and the end of God-backed city-states. Gods would no longer interact with humanity like they had previously. Surviving groups from the befallen city-states of the War would attempt to rebuild and roaming tribes, no longer entrapped in constant battle, would begin constructing their own settlements.

Some of the first notable civilizations to develop would be human-dominated, developing close to major coastal rivers. Gods would watch the rise of these civilizations from a distance and document them in stars like the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Geography/Astrography/Watchers Star|Watchers Star]] and [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Geography/Astrography/Star Systems/New World System|New World System]]. Sometime in the late 10's [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Geography/Artificial Features/Betorn|Betorn]] would form at the southern end of the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Geography/Natural Features/Great Tear|Great Tear]]. Remaining survivors of Sextown would create [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Geography/Artificial Features/New Sextown|New Sextown]] on the banks of the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Geography/Natural Features/Eastern Tropical River|Eastern Tropical River]], followed by the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Geography/Artificial Features/Deltatown|Deltatown]] on the eastern edges of the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Geography/Natural Features/Eastern Mediterranean Delta|Eastern Mediterranean Delta]]. Early into the 40's the last of the major [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Geography/Natural Features/Outer Ring|Outer Ring]] civilizations would develop, known as the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Geography/Artificial Features/Western Mediciv|Western Mediciv]] on the banks of the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Geography/Natural Features/Western Outer River|Western Outer River]]. 

These would not be all though, the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Geography/Natural Features/Inner Ring|Inner Ring]] would give rise to two more notable civilizations in the 60's, the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Geography/Artificial Features/Inner Rainciv|Inner Rainciv]] along the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Geography/Natural Features/Southern Crater River|Southern Crater River]] and the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Geography/Artificial Features/Southern Deltown|Southern Deltown]] at the edges of the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Geography/Natural Features/Southern Crater Delta|Southern Crater Delta]].

These civilizations would all see the rise and invention of new and complex scientific concepts like [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Culture/Sciences & Technologies/Scientific Branches/Mathematics|mathematics]] and [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Culture/Sciences & Technologies/Scientific Branches/Astronomy|astronomy]], alongside inventions like [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Culture/Sciences & Technologies/Technologies/Writing|writing]], [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Culture/Sciences & Technologies/Technologies/Weaving|weaving]], [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Culture/Sciences & Technologies/Technologies/Money|money]], and [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Culture/Sciences & Technologies/Technologies/Pottery|pottery]]. Many of these civilizations would communicate and trade by sea and river. The domestication of [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Biology/Animals/Moose|moose]] in the Outer Ring would increase trade and communication between cities with improved transportation. As many of these civilizations grew some would attempt to move northward, but documented in stars like [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Geography/Astrography/Humanity Lost|Humanity Lost]], the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Geography/Natural Features/Great Northern Deserts|Great Northern Deserts]] and remaining [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Biology/Animals/Organisms of Mass Destruction|massively destructive organisms]] would end any attempts.
