Plants are defined by [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Culture/Sciences & Technologies/Scientific Theories & Laws/Criterial Classification|tri-criterial classification]] as any [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Biology/Organisms|organism]] incapable of powered locomotion, or by [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Culture/Sciences & Technologies/Scientific Theories & Laws/Evolutionary Classification|evolutionary classification]] as any second generation laboratorius organism conceptually evolved from the idea of a sessile organism capable of autonomous work. Within evolutionary classification the taxon of plants is succeeded by [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Biology/Taxa/Aseminifer|aseminifers]] and [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Biology/Taxa/Seminifer|seminifers]], being plants capable of asexual and sexual reproduction respectively.
