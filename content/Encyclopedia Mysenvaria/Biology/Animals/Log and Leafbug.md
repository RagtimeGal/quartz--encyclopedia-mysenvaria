Logbugs are [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Culture/Sciences & Technologies/Scientific Theories & Laws/Tri-Criterial Classification|classified]] as scuttling disruptive consumers which host the related symbiotic Leafbugs to disguise themselves as various [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Biology/Plant|trees]]. A host of different animals fall into this category, each very similar. They can be found across nearly all parts of the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Geography/Natural Features/Plane|Plane]], although their numbers have been significantly diminished in the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Geography/Natural Features/Southern Continent|South]].
# History
It is unknown when exactly these disruptive mimics first appeared on the Plane, but it is believed to have been sometime before the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/History/God-War Era/Great Flood|Great Flood]]. Star systems like the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Geography/Stars/Star Systems/Coalition Against Mimicry|Coalition Against Mimicry]] document mimics of equal and even greater magnitude than log and leafbugs. These stars imply that many Gods viewed [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Culture/Sciences & Technologies/Scientific Theories & Laws/Tri-Criterial Classification|disruptors]] like logbugs negatively. It is unknown what, if any, behavioral adaptations log and leafbugs took on after the end of the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/History/God-War Era/God-War Era|God-War]].

Logbugs, and their leafbug companions, have been known to attack loggers and have historically been a major nuisance and pest. While not carnivorous, they are known to attack if threatened or scared. Because of their diets, consisting primarily of grains and grasses, logbugs and leafbugs have been hunted to near extinction in the South.
# Anatomy
## Logbugs
Logbugs were created to mimic the trunks of trees, with stiff segmented bodies that can reach great lengths dependent on the species. Their outer carapace is textured similarly to the bark of the tree they were created to mimic. They have 6 limbs which they use for locomotion, two eyes, and antennae.

When a logbug is disguising itself they will stand their body up vertically, extending their back pair of legs and balancing the end of their abdomen on the ground. They will then extend out their two front pairs of legs and arrange them randomly to appear as branches, or in some species tuck them into the body.

It does not take more than five minutes for a logbug to disguise itself like this, but it is not complete without the help of leafbugs.
## Leafbugs
Leafbugs are considerably smaller, but can still greatly vary in size dependent on the species and tree they are mimicking. Leafbugs have flat bodies with abdomens shaped and colored like the leaves they are mimicking. 

Their abdomens are home to a pair of elytra and wings, something their logbug companions lack. Leafbugs are capable of powered flight for extended periods of time, and will follow moving logbugs in flying swarms.

They have 3 pairs of limbs, all attached at the bottom of their abdomen where it meets their head. This section of their body is colored similarly to the logbug they are paired with, and when disguised they will wrap their legs around the logbug with their abdomen pointed outwards.
# Ecology
## Diet
Logbugs and leafbugs are exclusively avivorous consumers, feeding on avoric organisms. Different species have widely varying avoric preference. Temperate log and leafbugs prefer grains and grasses, while tropical species have been documented to prefer fruits.
## Reproduction & Lifestyle
It is unknown how log or leafbugs reproduce as it has not been observed. Logbugs have been documented carrying eggs, said to place them in crevices of their bodies which are hidden when they disguise themselves.

Zoologists like [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/History/Biographies/Famed Biologist, Fitzgerald|Fitzgerald]] have theorized that logbugs and leafbugs may be capable of asexual reproduction, so as to allow them to reproduce while isolated during the God-War.

Logbugs are asocial, spending a majority of their lives alone and camouflaged. Leafbugs, however, spend their whole lives in massive colonies following logbugs. Logbugs can live for upwards of 30 years, comparatively leafbugs have much shorter lifespans of about 1 year.
## Predators & Disease
Because of their often sheer size, and the danger that attacking one may impose, logbugs do not have many predators. Leafbugs, with their close relationship to the logbugs, reap the benefits and also do not share many predators.

While they do not have many actual predators, it is not uncommon for other animals to confuse them for actual trees. This leads to situations where consumptive symbionts like [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Biology/Animals/Wood-beetle|wood-beetles]] may burrow into the carapace of logbugs, harming them. [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Biology/Animals/Woodpecker|Woodpeckers]] may also break apart the carapace of logbugs by drumming against them.

Leafbugs, often, will protect their companions by fighting off animals which may harm them, but often when disguised these animals are ignored.
## Range & Distribution
Logbugs and leafbugs were originally native to nearly every climate and biome of the Plane, having been wildly successful organisms after the end of the God-War. Today, however, they have gone nearly extinct in southern temperate climates, and are seeing quick decline in the southern tropics. Northern populations have been untouched for centuries.
