Mask-bear are a species of social carnivorous organisms specialized in hunting [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Biology/Animals/Organisms of Mass Destruction|Organisms of Mass Destruction]] using inflatable organs across many of their bodily orifices'. They are found across most of the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Geography/Natural Features/Northern Continent|New World]] along with minor sections of the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Geography/Natural Features/Southern Continent|Old World]]. 
# History
The first signs of the mask-bears in history appear to have been recorded in the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Geography/Astrography/Star Systems/Anti-Organics System|Anti-Organics System]] around 458bt, 18 years after the creation of the first organisms of mass destruction. Mask-bears would not be the final, or even first, organisms recorded in the star system created for the sole purpose of taking down OMD's, but they would be one of the only ones to survive to the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/History/Modern Era/Modern Era|Modern Era]]. [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Biology/Animals/Gas-Vulture|Gas-vultures]] are thought to be among one of the only other surviving members of the concept.
