Science is one of the six primary topics of the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Arts/Literature/Non-fiction/Encyclopedia Mysenvaria|Encyclopedia Mysenvaria]]. Science is a discipline that collects and organizes knowledge about the natural world through reproducible tests and predictions. Collected scientific knowledge is stored throughout the vast majority of the Encyclopedia, instead this section serves primarily to store knowledge regarding the practices, predictions, and applications of science.
# Branches
Scientific branches are specialized fields which focus on the study of specific aspects of the natural world. Major branches include fields like [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Biology/Biology|biology]], [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Geography/Geography|geography]], and [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Science/Branches/Mathematics|mathematics]]. Scientific branches can be very broad, like in the case of [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Science/Branches/Zoology|zoology]], or very specialized like in [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Science/Branches/Bioastronomy|bioastronomy]]. Each branch of science plays an integral role to furthering our knowledge of the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Geography/Natural Features/Plane|Plane]] 
# Phenomena
Scientific phenomena include short-term localized events and long-term physical patterns and processes which occur as a result of [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Science/Models/Natural Laws|natural laws]]. [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Science/Phenomena/Weather|Weather]], [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Science/Phenomena/Seasons|seasons]], and [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Science/Phenomena/Earthquake|earthquakes]] fall into the former category, being short-term localized events which occur commonly across the Plane. [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Science/Phenomena/Atmospheric Cells|Atmospheric cells]], [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Science/Phenomena/Day|day & night]], and [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Science/Phenomena/Tectonics|tectonics]] fall into the latter category, being long-term patterns which occur as a result of various natural processes.
# Models
Scientific models are developed through scientific practices and provide frameworks for organizing the natural world, providing structure to knowledge and aid in prediction of phenomena. For example, [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Science/Models/Natural Subdivision|natural subdivision]] models how Gods divide their territory and create new Gods, while [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Science/Models/Perennial Classification|perennial classification]] provides a system for dividing Gods into lesser and higher varieties.
# Technologies
Technology refers to the practical applications and devices which are created with scientific knowledge. Technological innovations serve to improve the lives of those who have access to it. Devices like [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Science/Technologies/Orrery|orreries]] or [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Science/Technologies/Star Map|star maps]] help scientists better organize or study the natural world. Others, like [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Science/Technologies/Printing Press|printing presses]] or [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Science/Technologies/Loom|looms]] serve to increase productivity and make some previously rare goods more accessible.
