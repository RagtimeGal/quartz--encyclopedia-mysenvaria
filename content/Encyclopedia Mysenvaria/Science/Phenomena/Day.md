Day is a period of time and localized event which occurs across the Plane. Days, as a [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Science/Technologies/Measurement|measurement]] of time, are defined as a period of 24 hours or the total time it takes for the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Geography/Stars/Harmonic Treaty|Harmonic Treaty]] to make a complete orbit around the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Geography/Abstract Features/Central Pole|pole]]. A period of 30 days is called a [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Science/Phenomena/Seasons|season]], and four seasons create one year. As the Treaty moves in its orbit it illuminates portions of the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Geography/Natural Features/Plane|Plane]], similarly to how a [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Science/Technologies/Lamp|lamp]] might. The spherical area around the Treaty which it illuminates is known as its 'area of influence'[^figure1].

Because of the way in which the Treaty illuminates the Plane different areas are illuminated for different periods of time. As you move further out from the harmony line towards the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Geography/Abstract Features/Edge|edge]] the period of time in which you are illuminated gradually decreases. The inverse occurs as you move towards the pole, with the amount of day which is illuminated gradually increasing.

Because the Treaty only illuminates a spherical area around itself different portions of the Plane are illuminated for different periods of time. The further outwards from the harmony line you move the longer or shorter the 'illumination period' becomes, the portion of the day which is illuminated by the Treaty. As you move towards the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Geography/Abstract Features/Edge|edge]] the period of illumination grows shorter, only a brief moment at the furthest. Inversely, as you move inward towards the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Geography/Abstract Features/Central Pole|pole]] the period of illumination grows longer, lasting indefinitely for some portions of the year, like [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Science/Phenomena/Seasons|summer]], when at the pole.
# History
In terms of the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Geography/Natural Features/Plane|Plane's]] age day has existed for longer than it has not. Following the end of the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/History/God-War Era/God-War Era|God-War Era]] and the beginning of the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/History/Post-War Era/Post-War Era|Post-War Era]] the passing of the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Geography/Stars/Harmonic Treaty|Harmonic Treaty]] would give rise to Day, the world previously having been enveloped in complete darkness. An event known as the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/History/Post-War Era/Great Dying|Great Dying]] would occur in the years following the rise of the Treaty.

[[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Science/Phenomena/Organisms|Organisms]] would have to adapt to rapidly changing environments, the Treaty creating new dangers. Day, [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Science/Models/Atmospheric Circulation|winds]], and [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Science/Phenomena/Tides|tides]] would be suddenly and violently introduced to the world, culminating in the Great Dying. Other factors, like the loss of [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Science/Phenomena/Gods|God's]] interference would also play roles in the event. Today, only a fraction of the wildlife which one existed remain across the Plane.
