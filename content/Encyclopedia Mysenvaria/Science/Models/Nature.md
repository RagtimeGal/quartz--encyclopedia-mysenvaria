Nature refers to the metaphysical processes and laws and the physical materials and interactions which create reality. [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Science/Phenomena/Natural Personification|Natural personification]] is a [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Science/Science#Phenomena|phenomena]] which explains natures tendency towards materialization and personification, manifesting in other phenomena like [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Science/Phenomena/Gods|Gods]], [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Science/Phenomena/Stars|stars]], and [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Science/Phenomena/Mythril|mythril]].

Natural Personification gives rise to complex phenomena as a result of direct natural laws outlined in the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Geography/Stars/First Epoch Star|First Epoch Star]]. This is opposed to emergent phenomena like [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Science/Phenomena/Organisms|organisms]] which occur as a result of unintended complex interactions between the natural laws. In both cases, nature is the source of the complex phenomena, directly or indirectly.
# History
Nature has existed since [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/History/God-War Era/God-War Era#Prehistory|Prehistory]], starting with the creation of the First Epoch Star by the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/History/Biographies/Gods/Gods of Life and Death|Gods of Life and Death]]. The First Epoch Star details the original basal laws of nature, creating the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/History/Biographies/Gods/Gods of Matter, Energy, Time, and Space|Gods of Matter, Energy, Time, and Space]] and their respective aspects of nature.

The [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/History/God-War Era/Quickening|Quickening]] would be a defining moment for the future of nature, as the basic physical [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Geography/Natural Features/Plane|Plane]] would be formed in its wake. Throughout the course of the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/History/God-War Era/God-War Era|God-War Era]] many new additional laws and reforms would be put in place to thwart attempts at manipulating the natural system. Legal stars like the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Geography/Stars/Elemental Act|Elemental Act]] and [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Geography/Stars/Spatial Act|Spatial Act]] would build upon laws established in the First Epoch Star, not only directly limiting the capabilities of Gods but also establishing new universal natural laws.

By the end of the God-War the Plane had undergone a complete transformation, and the signing of the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Geography/Stars/Harmonic Treaty|Harmonic Treaty]] into the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/History/Post-War Era/Post-War Era|Post-War Era]] would continue that trend. The Treaty would not just build upon, add, and change existent laws, but create entirely new natural phenomena tailored to the new organisms which now inhabited the Plane as result of the war. The biggest change would be the introduction of the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Science/Phenomena/Day|day]] cycle, leading to the emergence of [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Science/Phenomena/Ocean Circulation|oceanic]] and [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Science/Models/Atmospheric Circulation|atmospheric circulation]], complex [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Science/Phenomena/Climate|climates]] and [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Science/Phenomena/Weather|weather]], [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Science/Phenomena/Seasons|seasons]], and more.
