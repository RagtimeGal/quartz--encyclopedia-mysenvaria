Tri-criterial classification is a theory of [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Science/Branches/Taxonomy|taxonomic]] classification of [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Science/Phenomena/Organisms|organisms]] now widely considered obsolete which posed that organisms may be classified according to three criteria; [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Science/Models/Body Plan|body plan]], [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Science/Models/Tri-Criterial Niches|historic niche]], and [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Science/Models/Dietary Classification|diet]]. Originally proposed by [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/History/Biographies/Famous Taxonomer|Famous Taxonomer]] the theory would go on to create a legacy, only recently being outdated by the onset of [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Science/Models/Evolutionary Classification|evolutionary classification]]. 
# History

# Criterion
Tri-criterial classification organizes organisms into groups based off of their 
## [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Science/Models/Dietary Classification|Diet]]
- Avores, organisms which do not consume biological matter.
- Consumers, which can be split into two groups;
	- Avovores, organisms which consume avoric organisms;
	- Bionivores, organisms which consume non-animate biological matter.
- Carnivores, organisms which consume consumers.
## [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Science/Models/Body Plan|Body Plan]]
- Plants, organisms which do not move.
    - Rooted, organisms which attach to objects using sub-surface roots.
    - Sessile, organisms which attach to objects at the surface.
- Animals, organisms which do move.
    - Quadrupeds, organisms which use 4 limbs for locomotion.
    - Bipeds, organisms which use 2 limbs for locomotion.
    - Scuttlers, organisms which use 5 or more limbs for locomotion.
    - Serpents, organisms which use no limbs for locomotion.
## [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Science/Models/Tri-Criterial Niches|Niche]]
- Expansionists, organisms which originally served to autonomously expand territory.
- Defenders, organisms which originally served to autonomously defend territory.
- Offenders, organisms which originally served to autonomously attack territory.
- Scouts, organisms which originally served to gauge the safety of a territory.
- Disruptors, organisms which originally snuck into opposing territories as agents of chaos.
- Symbionts, organisms which function by pairing closely with other organisms.
- Devastator, organisms specializing in heavy artillery, originally functioned to cause mass destruction.
# Significance
Tri-criterial classification is the first widely accepted taxonomic classification of organisms and changed many widely held beliefs and perceptions regarding flora and fauna.
