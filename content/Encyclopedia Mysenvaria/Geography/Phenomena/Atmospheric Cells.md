Atmospheric cells are complex and chaotic natural phenomena that occur as a result of many other factors across the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Geography/Natural Features/Plane|Plane]]. Atmospheric cells are critical to the theory of [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Geography/Phenomena/Atmospheric Circulation|atmospheric circulation]] and are responsible for the proper movement of air through the atmosphere. Cells develop because of interactions between the heating and [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Science/Principles/Gravity|gravitational pull]] of the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Geography/Stars/Harmonic Treaty|Harmonic Treaty]] and the friction caused by the Plane's rotation.

As the Harmonic Treaty makes its trip around the Plane the gravity it exerts pulls the air in the atmosphere along with itself. Alongside this, as the Treaty exerts heat it warms the nearby air, causing it to rise. This effect creates a vortex which pulls more cold air in to replace the rising warm air and is what circulates warm air throughout the entire Plane.
# The Cells
There are seven total cells across the Plane, 3 of which are located in the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Geography/Abstract Features/Inner Circle|inner circle]] and the remaining 4 in the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Geography/Abstract Features/Outer Ring|outer ring]]. This disparity is caused by the expansion of air as it moves outwards towards the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Geography/Abstract Features/Edge|edge]], and inversely the compression of the air as it moves inwards towards the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Geography/Abstract Features/Central Pole|pole]]. Pictured[^figure1] is a model of the atmospheric cells.

Starting at the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Geography/Abstract Features/Harmony Line|harmony line]] and moving inwards towards the pole:
- The inner Harmonic Cell lasts from the harmony line to 2,528km from the pole;
- The Inner Cell goes from the inner edge of the Harmonic Cell to 1,789km from the pole;
- And lastly, the Polar Cell goes from the inner edge of the Inner Cell to the pole.

Starting at the harmony line and moving outwards towards the edge:
- The outer Harmonic Cell lasts from the harmony line to 5,692km from the pole;
- The Inner Cell goes from the outer edge of the Harmonic Cell to 5,692km from the pole;
- The Outer Cell goes from the outer edge of the Inner Cell to 7,006km out from the pole;
- The Edge Cell goes from the outer edge of the Outer Cell to 8,319km from the pole.
