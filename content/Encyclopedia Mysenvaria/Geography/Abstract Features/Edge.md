The Edge is an abstract geographic feature which represents the furthest habitable regions of the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Geography/Natural Features/Plane|Plane]]. The edge serves as an important reference point for [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Culture/Topics/Science & Technology|scientific]] research thanks to its role in a number of natural phenomena.
# Geography
The edge represents the furthest habitable region of the Plane, positioned equidistant in all directions from the Plane's [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Geography/Abstract Features/Central Pole|pole]]. About 60% of the edge occupies land, the other remaining area lying over the oceans. The actual geography of the land beyond the edge is unknown, the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Geography/Phenomena/Fog|fog]] obstructing the Plane beyond.

The land before the edge primarily consists of flat arctic landscapes, and the oceans consist of [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Geography/Phenomena/Glaciers|glaciers]] and mixes of [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Geography/Phenomena/Seasons|seasonal]] and non-seasonal [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Geography/Phenomena/Ice Sheets|ice sheets]].
# History
During the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/History/God-War Era/God-War Era|God-War Era]] is appears as though the Plane had a much larger extent than what exists today, although the exact extent is unknown. Stars like [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Geography/Stars/Border Operation|Border Operation]], [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Geography/Stars/Frontier Beyond|Frontier Beyond]], and [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Geography/Stars/Claim Star|Claim Star]] give insight into the lives of lesser-[[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Science/Principles/Gods|Gods]] who had to compete for territory at the edge of the God-War Era.

Following the signing of the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Geography/Stars/Harmonic Treaty|Harmonic Treaty]] and the beginning of the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/History/Post-War Era/Post-War Era|Post-War Era]] the size of the habitable Plane would greatly shrink, becoming what it is known today.
# Climate & Ecology
Because of a multitude of factors, including the edge's distance from the Harmonic Treaty and the expansion of air as it [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Geography/Phenomena/Atmospheric Circulation|circulates]] towards the edge, the edge is in a nearly constant winter. This causes year-round [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Geography/Phenomena/Snow|snowfall]] and frigid conditions which are uninhabitable to most [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Science/Principles/Organisms|organisms]]. The ecosystems which have developed in these climates are highly specialized.

Ecosystems around the edge rely on [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Science/Principles/Criterial Classification|avoric expansionists]] of varying body plans. This group of organisms is primarily composed of small [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Biology/Taxa/Crustacea|crustacea]], like [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Biology/Taxa/Copepod|copepods]], arctic [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Biology/Taxa/Shrimp|shrimp]], and other specie's nymphs. Together with inanimate biological products, like eggs and feces, they construct the base of the food web around the edge. The edge, having such a large area of coverage, has a diverse cast of consumers and predators which depends on the region and time if year.

Large predators, like [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Biology/Species/Polar Dragon|Polar Dragons]], arctic [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Biology/Taxa/Whales|whale]] species, Lancing Squid, and arctic [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Biology/Taxa/Birds of Prey|Birds of Prey]] maintain sparse populations but large ranges. In the case of the well-known Polar Dragons their range has steadily been growing over the last hundred years, now reaching as far as the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Geography/Natural Features/Eastern Archipelago|Eastern Archipelago]].
