The central pole, usually referred to as just the pole, is an abstract geographic feature serving as the center of the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Geography/Natural Features/Plane|Plane]][^figure1]. The central pole is not necessarily an important landmark on its own but does serve as a reference point due to its role in a number of natural phenomena.
# Geography
The central pole serves as the exact center of the Plane, positioned equidistant from all points of the Plane's [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Geography/Abstract Features/Edge|edge]]. The pole happens to lie directly above the Plane's [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Geography/Natural Features/Ocean|ocean]] and also serves as the central point of [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Science/Phenomena/Ocean Circulation|oceanic circulation]][^figure2]. As the ocean's waters spiral towards the pole they quickly cool and sink, this process creates violent and volatile waters forming [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Science/Phenomena/Whirlpool|whirlpools]]. The area around the pole where these whirlpools form is known as the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Geography/Natural Features/Deadman's Sea|Deadman's Sea]].
# History
Before the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/History/God-War Era/Great Flood|Great Flood]] the pole was not located in a body of water. Outside of this knowledge, information on the exact geography of the pole during the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/History/God-War Era/God-War Era|God-War Era]] remains largely unknown. The pole played a significant role in the God-War, serving as a place of prestige which Gods sought to get closer to and claim as their own. [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Science/Technologies/Maps|Maps]] depicting territories from the war give ideas of which [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Science/Phenomena/Gods|Gods]] may have owned the pole at what points during the war, but these maps are generally created by [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Culture/Occupations & Crafts/Astronomer|astronomers]] and [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Culture/Occupations & Crafts/Cartographer|cartographers]] based on incomplete information and speculation. 

Until the end of the God-War the conditions necessary for the start of the Deadman's Sea would not exist. It would be the passing of the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Geography/Stars/Harmonic Treaty|Harmonic Treaty]] and beginning of the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/History/Post-War Era/Post-War Era|Post-War Era]] which would lead to the development of this new sea. The passing of the Harmonic Treaty would also redefine the importance of the central pole, making it the central point of the Treaty's orbit.

Early into the Post-War period the pole would become a focal point for scientific study, becoming vital to [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Science/Branches/Astronomy|astronomical]] studies. The position of the pole would become vital to the creation of early [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Science/Technologies/Clock|clocks]]. Despite the newfound importance the pole remains uninhabitable and for many researchers fosters a reputation of death.
# Climate & Ecology
The pole also serves as the central point of the Harmonic Treaty's orbit and the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Geography/Abstract Features/Harmony Line|harmony line]][^figure3]. This has the side effect of making the pole's average distance from the Treaty relatively stable throughout the year. Because of this, the pole does not experience the same levels of [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Science/Phenomena/Seasons|seasonal]] variation that other portions of the Plane experience.

The Deadman's Sea creates a relatively uninhabitable environment around the pole, the violent whirlpools creating turbulent conditions uninhabitable for most marine [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Science/Phenomena/Organisms|organisms]]. The corpses of some marine animals are known to be carried by the ocean's currents, ending up in the waters surrounding the pole. These corpses temporarily create conditions appealing enough for some sea birds to congregate in the waters, but their visits are often short lived as dangerous waters kill or scare them way.
