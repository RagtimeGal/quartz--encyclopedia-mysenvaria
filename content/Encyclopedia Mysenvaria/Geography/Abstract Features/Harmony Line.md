>This page is incomplete and could use further elaboration on its impact on [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Culture/Sciences & Technologies/Scientific Branches/Meteorology|meteorological]] [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Culture/Topics/Science & Technology|sciences]] in the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/History/History|History]] section! This callout serves as a future reminder!

The harmony line is a representation of the orbital pattern of the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Geography/Stars/Harmonic Treaty|Harmonic Treaty]] above the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Geography/Natural Features/Plane|Plane]]. The harmony line model is a useful tool for predicting the effects of the Harmonic Treaty at any given time. Despite often being depicted as directly between the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Geography/Abstract Features/Central Pole|pole]] and [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Geography/Abstract Features/Edge|edge]] the Treaty has a slightly eccentric orbit which rotates over time, making the common depiction inaccurate.

The model is used both by [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Culture/Occupations & Crafts/Astronomer|astronomers]], to predict the location of the Treaty and its impact on the visibility of local stars, and also by [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Culture/Sciences & Technologies/Scientific Branches/Meteorology|meteorologists]] to predict the impacts the Treaty may have on weather at a given moment. [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Culture/Sciences & Technologies/Technologies/Orrery|Orreries]] are small mechanical devices used by scientists to physically model the orbits of stars, and most often the orbit of the Harmonic Treaty.
# Orbital Details
Despite often being represented as completely circular the Harmonic Treaty's orbit follows a slight eccentricity of approximately 0.017. Despite being so minimal the eccentricity of the orbit is still enough to have noticeable impacts throughout the year as the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Geography/Phenomena/Seasons|seasons]] pass.

The orbital plane of the Treaty is tilted relative to the Plane by 7.25Â°. This tilt fluctuates throughout the year, its farthest and closest points defining the summer and winter [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Culture/Events & Holidays/Solstice|solstices]]. Alongside this however the Treaty's orbit precesses over a period of roughly every 2.7 years. Together these give the Treaty's orbit an oscillating pattern.

These factors give the Treaty its unique orbital pattern amongst the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Geography/Phenomena/Stars|stars]] and are what makes its physical interactions with the Plane so unique, responsible for [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Geography/Phenomena/Tides|tides]], [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Geography/Phenomena/Atmospheric Circulation|winds]], and seasons. This makes the Treaty highly valuable to researchers looking to understand more about the natural world.
# History
The Harmonic Treaty would be created at the end of the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/History/God-War Era/God-War Era|God-War Era]], marking the beginning of the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/History/Post-War Era/Post-War Era|Post-War Era]]. The Treaty's great impacts on the world would make it the focus of many developing nations interests. It would not take long following its creation for the first civilizations to begin modelling its orbit, creating the first depictions of the harmony line.

These models would be used for [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Culture/Sciences & Technologies/Technologies/Measurement|measuring]] time, creating the first primitive forms of [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Culture/Sciences & Technologies/Technologies/Clock|clocks]] by tracking the position or size of the Treaty in the sky relative to one's position on the Plane. These would later be refined into more complex devices and easier tools to tell the time.
