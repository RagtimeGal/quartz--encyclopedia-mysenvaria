The Heavens is an [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Geography/Geography#Abstract Features|abstract]] geographical feature used to refer to the space above the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Geography/Natural Features/Atmosphere|atmosphere]]. The heavens are devoid of air and are where [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Science/Phenomena/Stars|stars]] reside in orbit. While the heavens itself does not have a major impact on the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Geography/Natural Features/Plane|Plane]] the stars greatly impact the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Science/Models/Nature|natural laws]] of the world.
# History
The heavens have existed since the creation of the Plane by the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/History/Biographies/Gods/Gods of Life and Death|Gods of Life and Death]]. According to most translations of the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Geography/Stars/First Epoch Star|First Epoch Star]], when creating the Plane Life and Death would divide it into infinitely inequal thirds, creating the earth, atmosphere, and heavens.

During the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/History/God-War Era/God-War Era|God-War]] the heavens would be bombarded with stars, with more stars dating to the God-War than all other eras of history combined. Following the end of the God-War and beginning of the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/History/Post-War Era/Post-War Era|Post-War Era]] the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Geography/Stars/Harmonic Treaty|Harmonic Treaty]] would be signed by all God's. This act would completely change the world, introducing [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Science/Models/Atmospheric Circulation|atmospheric circulation]], [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Science/Phenomena/Day|day and nights]], and [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Science/Phenomena/Tides|tides]].

Research into the dynamics of the heavens and stars would grow intense into the Post-War Era as the first civilizations would develop. Research by early [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Culture/Occupations & Crafts/Astronomer|astronomers]] would lead to more developed understandings of [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Culture/Languages/God Tongue|God Tongue]] and artificial stars. Some stars, like the Treaty, would become the forefront of research, leading to developments like primitive [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Science/Technologies/Clock|clocks]] and [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Science/Technologies/Orrery|orreries]].
# Geography
The dividing line between the heavens and atmosphere is believed to be very strict, forming a semi-sphere dome over the top of the habitable Plane. At the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Geography/Abstract Features/Edge|edge]] of the Plane the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Geography/Natural Features/Great Fog|Great Fog]] is said to be visible curving over the sphere. Because of the lack of atmosphere when entering the heavens it is inhabitable, and is as such considered to be the end of the Plane's habitable zone.

The heavens themselves seem to be infinite in vastness, extending past the edge indefinitely. The empty space of the heavens are broken apart by occasional stars, although they do not reach very far away from the dome. The largest of the stars is the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Geography/Stars/Harmonic Treaty|Harmonic Treaty]], whose lowest point in orbit is believed to nearly touch the surface of the atmosphere.
