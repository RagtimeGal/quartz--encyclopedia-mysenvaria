[[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Biology/Sophonts/Gods|God]]-parts are segments of a deceased, or even living, Gods body. They are obtained by various means and are integral to some forms of [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Culture/Sciences & Technologies/Scientific Branches/Wizardry|wizardry]], most importantly the art of [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Culture/Sciences & Technologies/Technologies/Grafting|grafting]]. God-parts are innately dangerous, exhibiting many of the same properties as [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Geography/Resources/Mythril|mythril]].
