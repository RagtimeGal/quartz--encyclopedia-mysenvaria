The Lover's Stars are a pair of binary [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Culture/Sciences & Technologies/Scientific Phenomena/Stars|stars]], Tectonic Tears and Raging Water, which orbit one another. Created by the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/History/Biographies/Gods/Phenomena Gods/Gods of Earth/God of Tectonics|God of Tectonics]] and [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/History/Biographies/Gods/Compound Gods/God of Water|God of Water]] during their battle with one another. Water having contacted the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/History/Biographies/Gods/Gods of Matter, Energy, Time, and Space|God of Matter]] regarding the ongoing [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Biology/Mortals|mortal]]-[[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Biology/Sophonts/Gods|God]] relations being held by Tectonics would be ignored. Fearing what would come of these unions would take matters into their own hands, slaying Tectonics.

The stars would be created shortly before the end of the battle, Tectonic Tears would fall to the ground as a fallen star, being retrieved and returned to the sky by Water.
