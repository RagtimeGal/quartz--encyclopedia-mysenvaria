The Repetitive Crystal System is a star system created around in the year 118bt. The host star, the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Geography/Astrography/Half-life System/Half-life Star|Half-life Star]], was created by the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/History/Biographies/Gods/Elemental Gods/God of Plutonium|God of Plutonium]] prior to their fight with the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/History/Biographies/Gods/Gods of Matter, Energy, Time, and Space|God of Time]]. Plutonium, upset with Time's inaction regarding the half-life of many elements, would attempt to confront Time. The host star would be created by Plutonium to explain their stance on the situation. The fight would be initiated by Time, tackling Plutonium into the ground the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Geography/Natural Features/Southern Crater Scape|Southern Crater Scape]] would be created. splitting the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Geography/Natural Features/Northern Continent|North]] from the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Geography/Natural Features/Southern Continent|South]].

The two's fight would lead to the flooding of the system, with many Gods agreeing with the points Plutonium made regarding the rights of elements. The explosion of the system and acknowledgement of Plutonium's points would lead to the passing of the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Geography/Astrography/Spatial Act|Spatial Act]]. The fight would also indirectly lead to the death of [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/History/Biographies/Josh Soundson|Josh Soundson]], which would cause the holding of the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/History/God-War Era/God Councils|Sixth God Council]]. Altogether, the Half-Life System was a majorly influential system in ending the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/History/God-War Era/God-War Era|God-War]].
