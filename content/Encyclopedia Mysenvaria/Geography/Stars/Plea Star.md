The Plea Star is a [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Geography/Phenomena/Stars|star]] created by the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/History/Biographies/Gods/Compound Gods/God of Sodium Ethyl Xanthate|God of Sodium Ethyl Xanthate]] shortly before their death. The star would be released back into the sky by the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/History/Biographies/Gods/Elemental Gods/God of Cerium|God of Cerium]]. In the final moments of their life, Sodium Ethyl Xanthate would release the star, a final plea to end the war. Pointing out the causalities, both amongst the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Biology/Sophonts/Gods|Gods]] and [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Biology/Mortals|mortals]], Sodium Ethyl Xanthate would sway the hearts of many Gods and inevitably lead to the end of the war.
