The First Crater System is a minor [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Stars|star]] system created in the year 587bt, shortly after the first major battle of the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/History/God-War Era/God-War Era|God-War]]. The host star of the system, the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Geography/Stars/First Crater System/First Crater Star|First Crater Star]], written by the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/History/Biographies/Gods/Compound Gods/God of Calcium Acetate|God of Calcium Acetate]], details a heated debate and the ensuing fight between the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/History/Biographies/Gods/Elemental Gods/God of Carbon|God of Carbon]] and [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/History/Biographies/Gods/Elemental Gods/God of Calcium|God of Calcium]]. The star documents the creation of the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Geography/Natural Features/Great Oceanic Crater|Great Oceanic Crater]], a [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Natural Features|natural feature]] which would go on to be buried in the ocean after the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/History/God-War Era/Great Flood|Great Flood]].
