The Elven Star System is a [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Geography/Phenomena/Stars|star]] system whose host star, the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Geography/Stars/Elven Star System/Elves Star|Elves Star]], was created by the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/History/Biographies/Gods/Compound Gods/God of Penguinone|God of Penguinone]] to document their creation of the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Biology/Disease/Elf|elves]], defending their legality and ethicality against those who may debate it. The star would quickly be flooded with minor debate and debacle, creating the 56-star system known today.
