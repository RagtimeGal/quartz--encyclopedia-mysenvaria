Alex's Star System is a system created around 441bt, the host [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Geography/Topics/Stars|star]], [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Geography/Stars/Alex's Star System/Alex's Star|Alex's Star]], was created by the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/History/Biographies/Gods/Phenomena Gods/Gods of Earth/God of Igneous Rock|God of Igneous Rock]]. Upset by the creation of [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Biology/Sophonts/Human|humans]] by their relative, the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/History/Biographies/Gods/Phenomena Gods/Gods of Earth/God of Porous Rock|God of Porous Rock]], Igneous would create the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Geography/Topics/Stars|star]] claiming that Porous Rock would upset the balance of the war, had stolen the idea, and that their creation was morally upsetting for nature. The system would erupt into debate, and would be the cause of the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/History/God-War Era/God Councils|Second God Council]] and the passing of the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Geography/Stars/Creations Act|Creations Act]]. The system is related to similar stars, like [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Geography/Stars/Humanity Recycled|Humanity Recycled]].
