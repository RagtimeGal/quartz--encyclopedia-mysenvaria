The Apology System is a [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Geography/Topics/Stars|star]] system whose host star, the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Geography/Stars/Apology System/Apology Star|Apology Star]], was created by the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/History/Biographies/Gods/Elemental Gods/God of Hydrogen|God of Hydrogen]] and [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/History/Biographies/Gods/Elemental Gods/God of Oxygen|God of Oxygen]]. Apologizing after the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/History/Biographies/Gods/Elemental Gods/God of Sodium|God of Sodium]] exposed a plan set forth by the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/History/Biographies/Gods/Compound Gods/God of Water|God of Water]], [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/History/Biographies/Gods/Compound Gods/God of Trioxidane|God of Trioxidane]], and the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/History/Biographies/Gods/Compound Gods/God of Hydrogen Peroxide|God of Hydrogen Peroxide]], and promising to keep them under control, the two Gods would fall under scrutiny by other [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Indexes/History/Biographies/Gods/List of Elemental Gods|elemental Gods]] claiming that they should keep their children under control, the system would be flooded with new stars. Nothing would be heard from the Oxygen-Hydrogen trio until the onset of the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/History/God-War Era/Great Flood|Great Flood]], which would lead to the passing of the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Geography/Stars/Elemental Act|Elemental Act]].
