The Dwarven[](Meta/Stubs.md)mid-sized [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Geography/Topics/Stars|star]] system created following the creation of the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Biology/Sophonts/Dwarf|dwarves]] by [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Biology/Sophonts/Human|humanity]] to discuss the legality of their creation in regards to the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Geography/Stars/Creations Act|Creations Act]] which had been passed 12 years prior. The system would gain a number of stars shortly after its creation, beginning with the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Geography/Stars/Dwarven Star System/Dwarf Star|Dwarf Star]] by [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/History/Biographies/Gods/Compound Gods/God of Carbon Dioxide|God of Carbon Dioxide]], but by the end of the ordeal consisting of 82 stars.
