The Afterlife System is a large system of [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Science/Phenomena/Stars|stars]]. The host of the system, the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Geography/Stars/Afterlife System/Afterlife Star|Afterlife Star]], had originally been created by the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/History/Biographies/Gods/Energy Gods/God of Chromodynamic Energy|God of Chromodynamic Energy]] at the beginning of the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/History/God-War Era/God-War Era|God-War Era]] following [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/History/God-War Era/The First Convening|The First Convening]] and served as a document of what had been discussed by members and concluded that there must be an [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Culture/Beliefs/Afterlife|afterlife]]. The star would see a resurgence in popularity with the creation of [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Biology/Species/Human|humans]].
