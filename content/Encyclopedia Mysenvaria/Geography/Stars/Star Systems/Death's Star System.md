Death's Star System originated with the beginning of the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/History/God-War Era/God-War Era|God-War]], documenting the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/History/God-War Era/First Death of a God|first death of a God]]. The host [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Stars|star]] of the system, [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Geography/Stars/Death's Star System/Death's Star|Death's Star]], was created by the unknown perpetrator God documenting their fight with the God they slayed. The death of the unknown God would cause a series of events which would begin the God-War. The system would explode into over 150 stars, with Gods discussing and bickering on topics regarding their mortality.
