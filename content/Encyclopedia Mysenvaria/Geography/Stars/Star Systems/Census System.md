The Census System is a small system of [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Stars|stars]] created during the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/History/God-War Era/God-War Era|God-War]] which served to try and document the ever-decreasing number of [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Biology/Sophonts/Gods|Gods]] across the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Geography/Natural Features/Plane|Plane]] towards the end of the war. The host star of the system, the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Geography/Stars/Census System/Census Star|Census Star]], was created by the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/History/Biographies/Gods/Gods of Past, Present, and Future|God of Present Time]]. The system is small, with only 8 surrounding stars, Present Times call fell to deaf ears in an ever more quiet world.
