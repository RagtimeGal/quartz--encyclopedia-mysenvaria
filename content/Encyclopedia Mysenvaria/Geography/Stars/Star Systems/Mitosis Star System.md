The Mitosis Star System is a major [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Stars|star]] system. The host star, the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Geography/Stars/Mitosis Star System/Mitosis Star|Mitosis Star]], was created by the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/History/Biographies/Gods/Compound Gods/God of Hydrogen Peroxide|God of Hydrogen Peroxide]] and documents their creation of [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Biology/Animal|animals]]. Unlike similar stars, such as [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Geography/Stars/Carbonprint|Carbonprint]] and [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Geography/Stars/Cilia Star|Cilia Star]], the Mitosis System blew up in popularity amongst the Gods, becoming a central part of the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/History/God-War Era/Iteration Period|Iteration Period]].
