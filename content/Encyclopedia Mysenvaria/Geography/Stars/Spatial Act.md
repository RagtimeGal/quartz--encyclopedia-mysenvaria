The Spatial Act is a [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Indexes/Geography/Stars/List of Legally Binding Stars|legal]] [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Geography/Topics/Stars|star]] passed by the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/History/Biographies/Gods/Gods of Matter, Energy, Time, and Space|God of Time and God of Space]]. Following a disagreement and fight between the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/History/Biographies/Gods/Elemental Gods/God of Plutonium|God of Plutonium]] and Time the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Geography/Natural Features/Southern Crater Scape|Southern Crater Scape]] would form, splitting the land bridge which connected the two continents at the time. This act would force Time and Space to hold a meeting between the material Gods, passing the act. This would also lead to the holding of the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/History/God-War Era/God Councils|sixth God council]].
