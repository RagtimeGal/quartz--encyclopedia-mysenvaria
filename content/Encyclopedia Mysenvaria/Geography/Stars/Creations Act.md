The Creations Act is a [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Indexes/Geography/Stars/List of Legally Binding Stars|legal]] [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Science/Phenomena/Stars|star]] passed following the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/History/God-War Era/God Councils|second God council]]. Called by the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/History/Biographies/Gods/Gods of Life and Death|Gods of Life and Death]] because of [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Biology/Species/Human|humanities]] creation. Stars like [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Geography/Stars/Humanity Recycled|Humanity Recycled]] and [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Geography/Stars/Star Systems/Alex's Star System|Alex's Star System]] would lead to the passing of the act, forcing [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Science/Phenomena/Gods|Gods]] to slow down the creation of [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Science/Phenomena/Organisms|organisms]]. The star would not make Gods forfeit the right to creation, but instead placed strict regulations on the creation of new organisms.

12 years after its passing humanity would create [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Biology/Species/Dwarf|dwarves]], causing much debate on the legality of the creation and giving rise to the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Geography/Stars/Star Systems/Dwarven Star System|Dwarven Star System]].
