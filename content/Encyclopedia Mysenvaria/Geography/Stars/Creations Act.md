The Creations Act is a [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Indexes/Geography/Stars/List of Legally Binding Stars|legal]] [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Geography/Topics/Stars|star]] passed following the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/History/God-War Era/God Councils|second God council]]. Called by the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/History/Biographies/Gods/Gods of Life and Death|Gods of Life and Death]] because of [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Biology/Sophonts/Human|humanities]] creation stars like [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Geography/Stars/Humanity Recycled|Humanity Recycled]] and [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Geography/Stars/Star Systems/Alex's Star System|Alex's Star System]] would lead to the passing of the act. The Creations Act forced [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Biology/Sophonts/Gods|Gods]] to slow down their creation of [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Biology/Organisms|organisms]], but did not completely make them forfeit this right, instead placing strict regulations on the creation of new organisms.

The Creations Act would be followed by the creation of [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Biology/Sophonts/Dwarf|dwarves]] by humanity nearly 12 years later. This would give rise to much debate on the legality of this creation, giving rise to the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Geography/Stars/Star Systems/Dwarven Star System|Dwarven Star System]].
