Population Zero is a [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Geography/Topics/Stars|star]] created by an unknown [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Biology/Sophonts/Gods|God]] but released back into the sky by the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/History/Biographies/Gods/Elemental Gods/God of Iodine|God of Iodine]]. The star discusses the increasingly low population of Gods across the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Geography/Natural Features/Plane|Plane]] towards the end of the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/History/God-War Era/God-War Era|God-War]].
# Etymology
