The Anti-Womb Agreement was passed by a multitude of [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Biology/Sophonts/Gods|Gods]] occupying territories in the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Geography/Natural Features/Northern Continent|north]] during the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/History/God-War Era/God-War Era|God-War]]. The agreement aimed to stop any nonconsensual mortal-God relations from taking place. It was passed as a result of the birth of [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/History/Biographies/Charles Lightningson|Charles Lightningson]], the first [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Biology/Sophonts/Womb-God|Womb-God]].
