Organic Destruction is a child [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Geography/Topics/Stars|star]] of the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Geography/Stars/Mitosis Star System/Mitosis Star|Mitosis Star]], part of the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Geography/Stars/Star Systems/Mitosis Star System|Mitosis Star System]]. It was created by the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/History/Biographies/Gods/Compound Gods/God of Tetrahydropyridine|God of Tetrahydropyridine]] in the year 476bt to document their creation of the first organism of mass destruction. The star would cause a large bit of debate, being the primary reason the Mitosis System became more popular than related stars like [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Geography/Stars/Carbonprint|Carbonprint]] or the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Geography/Stars/Cilia Star|Cilia Star]].
