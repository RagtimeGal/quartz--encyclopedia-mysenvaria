Mortality Revisited is a [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Geography/Phenomena/Stars|star]] dated from the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/History/God-War Era/Lover's Period|Lover's Period]] which details a relationship held between the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/History/Biographies/Gods/Compound Gods/God of Molybdenum Bromide|God of Molybdenum Bromide]] and an unnamed [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Biology/Species/Human|human]]. The star, created by Molybdenum Bromide, reflects on their own mortality and the events of the war, speaking of the connection they form with their human mate and the strange feelings which followed the passing of the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Geography/Stars/Relations Act|Relations Act]].
