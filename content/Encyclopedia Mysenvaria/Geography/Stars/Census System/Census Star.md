The Census Star, created by the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/History/Biographies/Gods/Gods of Past, Present, and Future|God of Present Time]], served to call out to other [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Biology/Sophonts/Gods|Gods]] across the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Geography/Natural Features/Plane|Plane]], asking them to count the number of neighboring Gods so as to allow Present Time to get a good understanding of the remaining number of Gods.
