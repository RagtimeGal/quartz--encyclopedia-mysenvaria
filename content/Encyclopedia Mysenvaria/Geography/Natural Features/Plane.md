The Plane is the infinite and nearly-flat expanse which the known world resides upon. The exact vastness of the Plane is unknown, but it is presumed by many scholars to be infinite. 

Although the Plane may be infinitely vast, only a small portion of it is actually habitable. This portion extends from the Plane's [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Geography/Abstract Features/Central Pole|central pole]] to around 8757.84km out, to what is known as the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Geography/Abstract Features/Edge|edge]]. About halfway from the pole to the edge is the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Geography/Abstract Features/Harmony Line|harmony line]], an approximation of the average path the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Geography/Stars/Harmonic Treaty|Harmonic Treaty]] takes. From the harmony line to the pole is the area known as the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Geography/Abstract Features/Inner Circle|inner circle]], and outwards from the harmony line to the edge is the area known as the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Geography/Abstract Features/Outer Ring|outer ring]].[^figure1]

Prior to the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/History/God-War Era/God-War Era|God-War]] the habitable Plane is believed to have been larger than it stands in the present day. The reasons for the change are unknown, but following the signing of the Harmonic Treaty, the extent of the habitable Plane would shrink to the size seen in the present day.

At the edge of the Plane resides a thick fog which, as referenced in the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Geography/Stars/First Epoch Star|First Epoch Star]], is believed to be the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/History/Biographies/Gods/Gods of Life and Death|Gods of Life and Death]].
# History
It is unknown whether or not the Plane was created by the Gods of Life and Death or whether it too has existed since the beginning. It is believed too that when initially created the Plane was truly flat, with no imperfections. It would not be until early into the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/History/God-War Era/Quickening|quickening]] when the first imperfections would appear in its surface.

The Plane would be shaped into how we know it today through the events of the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/History/God-War Era/God-War Era|God-War]]; the corpses and battles of the Gods forming and sculpting the terrain. The first of such events, a dispute between the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/History/Biographies/Gods/Elemental Gods/God of Carbon|God of Carbon]] and [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/History/Biographies/Gods/Elemental Gods/God of Calcium|God of Calcium]], would create the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Geography/Natural Features/Great Oceanic Crater|Great Oceanic Crater]].

The creation of [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Biology/Taxa/Plant|plants]], in the year 523bt, would also be a turning point in the geologic history of the Plane. Plants would inadvertently work to break up the top layer of earth and create [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Science/Principles/Soil Theory|soil]]. While plants had already established ecosystems across the Plane they moved incredibly slow, the creation of [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Biology/Taxa/Animal|animals]] would speed up these ecosystems.
