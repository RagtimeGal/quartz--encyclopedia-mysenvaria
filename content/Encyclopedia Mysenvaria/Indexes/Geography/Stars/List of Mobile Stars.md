This page serves as an index of mobile [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Culture/Sciences & Technologies/Scientific Phenomena/Stars|stars]], defined as stars which move, often orbiting around a singular point in space, and are not stationary. Orbital stars are often more imporant than their stationary counterparts. This page is sorted by [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Indexes/Geography/Stars/List of Intra-Planar Stars|intra-planar]] and [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Indexes/Geography/Stars/List of Extra-Planar Stars|extra-planar]] stars.
