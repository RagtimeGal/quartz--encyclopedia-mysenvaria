This page serves as an index of extra-planar [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Science/Phenomena/Stars|stars]], stars classified as existing outside the airspace of the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Geography/Natural Features/Plane|Plane]]. This includes [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Indexes/Geography/Stars/List of Mobile Stars|mobile star's]] whose orbits may be inter-planar (inside and outside of the Plane's airspace). These stars are rarer than [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Indexes/Geography/Stars/List of Intra-Planar Stars|intra-planar stars]] (inside the Plane's airspace) and often have wide-reaching consequences and meaning.

# Extra-Planar Stars
Extra-planar stars are stationary or mobile stars whose orbits do not overlap with the Plane's airspace.

# Inter-Planar Stars
Inter-planar stars are mobioe stars whose orbits do overlap with the Plane's airspace.
