# Etymology

[](Meta/Stubs.md)ogy is not necessary. It should detail where the name of the animal in different languages across the Plane comes from.
# History

# Soil Types
- **Alfisols:** Low to moderate elevations in humid subtropical, humid continental, and Mediterranean climates. They are likely to be deposited by rivers.
- **Andisols:** Various elevations, often highlands, in marine west coast, humid subtropical, and tropical rainforest climates.
- **Aridisols:** Various elevations, often lowland deserts, in hot and cold desert climates.
- **Entisols:** Various elevations, from floodplains to mountains, in a wide range of climates. They are likely to be deposited by rivers.
- **Gelisols:** Low to moderate elevations in tundra and ice cap climates.
- **Histosols:** Lowland areas in wetlands within humid continental and marine west coast climates.
- **Inceptisols:** Various elevations, from floodplains to mountains, in a wide range of climates. They are likely to be deposited by rivers.
- **Mollisols:** Low to moderate elevations in cold semi-arid and humid continental climates. They are likely to be deposited by rivers.
- **Oxisols:** Various elevations, often in tropical lowlands, in tropical rainforest and tropical savanna climates.
- **Spodosols:** Low to moderate elevations in subarctic and humid continental climates.
- **Ultisols:** Various elevations, often in hilly or upland areas, in humid subtropical and tropical rainforest climates.
- **Vertisols:** Various elevations, often in flat or gently sloping areas, in semi-arid steppe and humid subtropical climates.

- **Shield Volcanoes**: Broad, gentle slopes; formed by low-viscosity basaltic lava; non-explosive eruptions. 
  - **Common Locations**: Hot spots (e.g., Hawaiian Islands), divergent plate boundaries (e.g., Iceland).
- **Stratovolcanoes**: Steep, conical; formed by alternating layers of lava and volcanic debris; explosive eruptions. 
  - **Common Locations**: Convergent plate boundaries (e.g., Pacific Ring of Fire), volcanic arcs.
- **Cinder Cone Volcanoes**: Small, steep slopes; formed by volcanic debris; short-lived and moderately explosive. 
  - **Common Locations**: Flanks of larger volcanoes, rift zones, volcanic fields.
- **Lava Domes**: Steep-sided, dome-like; formed by highly viscous lava; potential for explosive activity. 
  - **Common Locations**: Volcanic arcs, continental volcanic regions, associated with stratovolcanoes and caldera complexes.
