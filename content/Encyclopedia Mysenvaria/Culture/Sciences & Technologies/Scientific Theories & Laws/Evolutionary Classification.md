Evolutionary classification is a system of [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Culture/Sciences & Technologies/Scientific Branches/Taxonomy|taxonomic]] classification of [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Biology/Organisms|organisms]] which poses that organisms may be divided into groups based on similarity of concept or execution by the Gods. This type of classification gives rise to a tree-like structure showing the evolution of concepts Gods had while creating organisms during the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/History/God-War Era/God-War Era|God-War]]. 
# History

# Taxa
Evolutionary classification divides organisms into conceptual groups known as taxa. A taxon includes one or more populations of conceptually related organisms. There is a hierarchy of taxonomic ranks which taxa may be organized into based on conceptual importance. For instance, [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Biology/Animals|animals]] and [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Biology/Plants|plants]] are of highest conceptual importance since they are defined by an idea which permeates all other ranks.
