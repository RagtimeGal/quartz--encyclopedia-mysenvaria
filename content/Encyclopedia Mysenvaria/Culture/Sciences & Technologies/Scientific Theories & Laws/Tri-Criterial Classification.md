Tri-criterial classification is a form of [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Culture/Sciences & Technologies/Scientific Branches/Taxonomy|taxonomic]] classification of [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Biology/Organisms|organisms]] which poses that organisms may be classified according to three criteria; diet, body plan, and historic niche. Tri-criterial classification was first proposed by [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/History/Biographies/Famous Taxonomer|Famous Taxonomer]] and [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/History/Biographies/Also A Famous Taxonomer|Also A Famous Taxonomer]]. 

Recently [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Culture/Sciences & Technologies/Scientific Theories & Laws/Evolutionary Classification|evolutionary classification]] has arisen as an alternative form of classification, with many taxonomists beginning to reclassify organisms by evolutionary ideas.
# History

# Criterion
## Diet
- Avores, organisms which do not consume biological matter.
- Consumers, which can be split into two groups;
	- Avovores, organisms which consume avoric organisms;
	- Bionivores, organisms which consume non-animate biological matter.
- Carnivores, organisms which consume consumers.
## Body Plan
- Plants, organisms which do not move.
    - Rooted, organisms which attach to objects using sub-surface roots.
    - Sessile, organisms which attach to objects at the surface.
- Animals, organisms which do move.
    - Quadrupeds, organisms which use 4 limbs for locomotion.
    - Bipeds, organisms which use 2 limbs for locomotion.
    - Scuttlers, organisms which use 5 or more limbs for locomotion.
    - Serpents, organisms which use no limbs for locomotion.
## Niche
- Expansionists, organisms which originally served to autonomously expand territory.
- Defenders, organisms which originally served to autonomously protect territory.
- Offenders, organisms which originally served to autonomously attack territory.
- Scouts, organisms which originally served to gauge the safety of a territory.
- Disruptors, organisms which originally snuck into opposing territories as agents of chaos.
- Symbionts, organisms which function by pairing closely with other organisms.
- Devastator, organisms specializing in heavy artillery, originally functioned to cause mass destruction.
# Significance
Tri-criterial classification is the first widely accepted taxonomic classification of organisms and changed many widely held beliefs and perceptions regarding flora and fauna.
