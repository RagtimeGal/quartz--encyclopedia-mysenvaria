Wizardry is the study and performance of magic, the manipulation of nature by Godly means. [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Biology/Sapients/Gods|Gods]] gifted the mortals the ability to manipulate nature during the [[God-War Era|God-War]] as a means to improve their ability to fight and give some an even match against lower Gods.

The effects of the God's choice to do this is unprecedented and is perhaps the only reason sophontic mortals proved useful during the war. Not every sapient was treated equally by the Gods though, for instance [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Biology/Sapients/Human|Humans]] and [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Biology/Sapients/Dwarf|Dwarves]] can both speak God Tongue but [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Biology/Sapients/Elf|Elves]] cannot and instead are relegated to writing it as enchantments, which both the aforementioned sapients can also do. This has created imbalances in the powers of the sapients, which can be attributed as the cause of many historical events.

There are 3 notable classes of wizardry; written magic, spoken magic, and grafting magic. Written and Spoken involve the use of [[God Tongue]] to crast hexes and spells. Grafting involves the grafting of [[God Part|God Parts]] onto ones body to enhance themself.

Practitioners of magic are referred to as [[Wizard|Wizards]] or [[Mage|Mages]], typically depending on their association with governments, although this can change locally. Wizards are practitioners of magic who do not identify themselves as working with any governmental agency, while Mages are Wizards who work for governments. All Mages are Wizards, but not all Wizards are Mages. 

[[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Culture/Sciences & Technologies/Scientific Branches/Astronomy]] may sometimes be confused with wizardry, but they are two wholey different areas of study. [[Astronomer|Astronomers]] study the stars in an attempt to further the worlds understanding of Gods and God Tongue. They are solely responsible for a great deal of the information known about God Tongue in the [[Modern Era]].

# Spoken Magic
Spoken magic is the most common and easiest form of magic to learn, although it is still incredibly difficult to perform. Spoken magic, often referred to as spellcasting and spells, is performed by speaking in [[God Tongue]]. Real God Tongue cannot be spoken by mortals, and so they will never have the same control over nature as the Gods have with their own word. Instead, mortals speak a kind of anglicized God Tongue which can be pronounced and properly spoken by them.

This form of God Tongue is not perfect and at times is not even completed. Many words and much of the grammar of God Tongue is lost to mortals, locked behind the great minds of the Gods. Astronomers translate the stars in an attempt to decode God Tongue and further humanities understanding of it.

When mortals cast spells, their larynx ossifies; a cost which is to some too pricey to risk. The level of ossification is dependent on the strength of the spell cast. Casting a powerful spell can lead to the ossification of one's entire larynx, but the casting of a weak spell will only ossify a small part. And so a balance between casting time and strength must be found, or one may risk the loss of their ability to spellcast.

Spells can be remarkably powerful, warping reality to the user's will. Notable events throughout history of powerful spells are the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/History/Golden Age/Holding back of Sozins Comet|holding back of the big comet]], [[Luteces Time Travel Incident|changing history with voice funni]], and [[Ossification of the Battle for Whatevs|ossification of all the soldiers on a battlefield]]. 

# Written Magic
Written magic is less common than spoken magic and is notably harder to perform. It can be argued, however, that written magic has more applications than spoken magic. To perform written magic, often referred to as Hexing or Enchanting, one must have access to [[Mythril|mythril]]. Mythril forms exactly like Gods do and has many of their properties, but seemingly lacks consciousness.

Collection of mythril is a dangerous task which has cost many wizards and mages lives. [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Biology/Disease/Pneumomagiosis|Mages Lung Disease]] is a common affliction caught by wizards and mages while attempting to collect mythril. The disease can rarely cause [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Biology/Disease/Wild Magic|wild magic]] and [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Biology/Disease/Spell Malfunction|spell malfunction]], which has been known to put many wizards and mages out of their jobs. Mythril also attracts the attention of some wild animals like [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Biology/Fauna/Mythril Ants|mythril ants]] and [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Biology/Fauna/Mythril Scorpions|mythril scorpions]] which seek the mineral to use it in their own hexes. Dwarves, notably, are immune to the effects of mythril.

Written magic has its history traced back to the creation of elves, who the Gods blessed with an innate knowledge of enchanting. Because of this, elves are oft sought out by wizards and mages to hex their armies and items.

To cast a hex or enchant an item, one must write it out in God Tongue using mythril. This can be done in a number of ways; writing in [[Mythril Ink|mythril ink]], spreading mythril dust, or forging or chiseling mythril into the writing. It should be noted that as soon as a word is formed by the mythril the enchantment or hex is activated; even if not completed. This can be incredibly dangerous and has caused many accidents throughout history, one of the worst notably being the [[Dwarven Nuke|nuclear meltdown incident]]. 

Mythril ink is the oldest way of crafting enchantments and hexes, its history dating back to the creation of the elves during the God-War. It is used to this day by the Elves, and its recipe kept a trade secret by the Elders for millennia. Mythril ink has the advantage of containing so little mythril that what is written with it is not activated until more mythril dust is poured onto it. This has the advantage of not activating the enchantment until it is completed and gives control over how long the enchantment lasts based on how much dust is fed into the system.

# Grafting Magic
Grafting is the final form of magic, and the most controversial and powerful. Grafting requires little-to-no knowledge of any sciences to perform; all it requires is a [[God Part|God part]] and some patience. Most typically, the grafter will cut off one of their limbs and sow a God's limb in its place. This is enough to graft. The God's part naturally regenerates nerve endings, bones, muscles, veins, and all else and fuses them with the grafters body.

This process can and has been taken further, however. A body part does not have to be replaced to add the God's part to the grafters' body. An incision can be made anywhere and the God's part will naturally fuse to the grafter. Any God's part will do, be it heads, legs, arms, torsos, hands, feet, or fingers. This has led to many horrific stories of wizards and mages whose greed overcomes themselves.

An important side effect of this process is the loss of one's self-identity. When a grafter attaches a God's limb to themselves they do not feel it like they do a normal limb. In the case of it replacing one of their already existing limbs, the feeling of their original limb never goes away, and they do not feel the God's limb like they did their original. Where they may feel one elbow from their previous arm, they now look to see two on the God's.

Grafters may also not have complete control over their new limbs. Often the limbs retaliate to commands or even attack the grafter. [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/History/Biographies/Godefrey the Grafted|Cool guy]] is a well-documented case of a mage who grafted a God's limb to themselves and suffered the consequences.

There is also the case of [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/History/Biographies/Godrick the Grafted|Godrick the Grafted]], a mage who grafted the head of a God onto their back in the search of greater wisdom. Instead, they were welcomed to a short hell as the God forced their body onto the nearest pike, a fatal experience.

# Demi-Gods & Womb-Gods
[[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Biology/Sapients/Demi-God|Demi-Gods]] and [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Biology/Sapients/Womb-God|Womb-Gods]] are technically not a form of magic, but they are a byproduct of magic and are worth noting. Demi-Gods and Womb-Gods are born from the misuse of phallic God parts. Specifically, Demi-Gods are born when a mortal becomes pregnant from misuse of a God's penis, while Womb-Gods are born when a deceased God becomes pregnant from a mortal having intercourse with them.

Demi-Gods are naturally weaker than Womb-Gods, but are also due to their nature easier to care for while developing. Demi-Gods have lifespans nearly twice that of their parental mortal and take on mixed features from both of their parents. Demi-Gods are naturally more resistant to the ossification of their larynx and it is said that they are born with an unnatural understanding of God Tongue.

Womb-Gods grow in the body of the god, and naturally are more powerful than their Demi-God cousins. There have only been 3 Womb-Gods recorded in history, and thus not much is known about them. The first is known from the stars; a being who lived and died during the God-War. It is unknown how long a Womb-God can live for, but recounts of the few that have lived claim that their spells are not constrained by ossification. It may be assumed too that they are naturally born with an understanding of God Tongue, much like Demi-Gods.
