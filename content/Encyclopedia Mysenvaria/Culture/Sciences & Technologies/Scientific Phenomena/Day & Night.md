Day is both a period of time and also a localized event. As a [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Culture/Sciences & Technologies/Technologies/Measurement|measurement]] of time a day is a period of 24 hours, or the time it takes for the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Geography/Stars/Harmonic Treaty|Harmonic Treaty]] to make a complete trip around the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Geography/Abstract Features/Central Pole|pole]] following the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Geography/Abstract Features/Harmony Line|harmony line]]. As the Treaty moves in its orbit it illuminates portions of the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Geography/Natural Features/Plane|Plane]] around it much like a [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Culture/Sciences & Technologies/Technologies/Lamp|lamp]] would. The spherical area around the treaty which its light can reach is known as its 'area of influence'[^figure1].

Because of the way in which the Treaty illuminates the Plane different areas are illuminated for different periods of time. As you move further out from the harmony line towards the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Geography/Abstract Features/Edge|edge]] the period of time in which you are illuminated gradually decreases. The inverse occurs as you move towards the pole, with the amount of day which is illuminated gradually increasing.
# History
Because day is an effect of the Harmonic Treaty it would not exist until the start of the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/History/Post-War Era/Post-War Era|Post-War Era]]. Day would mark a significant change across the entirety of the Plane. Animals and plants alike would have to adapt to the changing environment or face extinction, culminating in the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/History/Post-War Era/Great Dying|Great Dying]].
