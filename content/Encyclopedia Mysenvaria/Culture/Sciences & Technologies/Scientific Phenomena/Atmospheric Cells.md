Atmospheric cells are a complex and chaotic natural phenomenon that occurs as a result of many factors across the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Geography/Natural Features/Plane|Plane]]. Atmospheric cells are critical to [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Culture/Sciences & Technologies/Scientific Theories & Laws/Atmospheric Circulation|atmospheric circulation]], responsible for the proper movement of air through the atmosphere. They develop in part due to the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Geography/Stars/Harmonic Treaty|Harmonic Treaty]] and the Plane's rotation.

There are seven total cells across the Plane, three of which are located in the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Geography/Natural Features/Inner Circle|inner circle]] and the remaining in the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Geography/Natural Features/Outer Ring|outer ring]]. This disparity is caused by the expansion of the air as it moves towards the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Geography/Abstract Features/Edge|edge]] and the compression of the air as it moves towards the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Geography/Abstract Features/Central Pole|pole]]. 

Pictured[^figure1] is a model of the atmospheric cells. Covering the inner circle's cells we start from the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Geography/Abstract Features/Harmony Line|harmony line]] and headed towards the central pole we begin with the Harmonic Cell, whose inner edge is roughly 2,528km from the pole. The Middle Cell spans from the inside of the Harmonic Cell to about 1,789km from the pole. Lastly, the Polar Cell lasts from the end of the Middle Cell and spans all the way to the pole.

The outer rings cells begin at the harmony line too, the first of which, the Harmonic Cell, spans to about 5,692km from the pole. The Second Cell spans from the edge of the Harmonic Cell to roughly 7,006km out from the pole. The Third Cell spans from the edge of the Second Cell to roughly 8,319km from the pole. And lastly the Edge Cell, which spans from the end of the Second Cell out to the edge of the Plane.
