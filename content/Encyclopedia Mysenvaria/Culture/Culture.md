Culture is one of the six primary topics of the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Arts/Literature/Non-fiction/Encyclopedia Mysenvaria|Encyclopedia Mysenvaria]]. Culture encompasses the beliefs, traditions, systems, and societies of the [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Geography/Natural Features/Plane|Plane]], exploring how populations organize, the values they hold, how they interact, the languages they speak, and more. The study of culture has significant overlap with the study of [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/History/History|history]], offering insight into how societies have evolved over time.
# Beliefs
Beliefs are the ideas and concepts which individuals and populations hold as truth. They include [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Indexes/Culture/List of Religions|religions]] and philosophies that form cultural norms and shape how societies perceive the world.
# Ethnic & Cultural Groups
Ethnic and cultural groups are populations that identify with one another through shared heritage, language, or beliefs. They are defined by the maintaining and evolution of unique customs and traditions that are tied to their unique histories and local [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Geography/Geography|geographies]]. Cultural groups have great influence over everything from governments and art.
# Events & Holidays
Events and [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Indexes/Culture/List of Holidays|holidays]] are periods of time recognized by populations to be for specific practices and customs. They range from religious festivals to seasonal celebrations like [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Culture/Events & Holidays/Solstice|solstices]]. Events reflect the values of cultures.
# Languages

Languages are essential for preservation of knowledge, social interaction, and everyday communication. Languages are deeply connected through [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Science/Models/Linguistic Evolution|evolution]]. Some languages hold religious or scholarly importance, like [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Culture/Languages/God Tongue|God Tongue]], and others are vastly spoken.
# Occupations & Crafts

These trades range from [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Culture/Occupations & Crafts/Doctor|doctors]] to [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Culture/Occupations & Crafts/Scalper|scalpers]] and [[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Culture/Occupations & Crafts/Cartographer|cartographers]]. Occupations play critical roles in society, contributing to and sustaining economies and cultures.
