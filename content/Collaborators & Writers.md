[[Encyclopedia Mysenvaria/Culture/Organizations/Academy Publishing Company|Academy Publishing Company]] makes it an effort to reach out to and collaborate with as many scholars as possible. With the objective of maintaining utmost truth in our pursuit of knowledge we think it is important to work with as diverse a cast of writers as possible. We work diligently to give each of our writers their own biography page.
